title: Pick Items | Microsoft Docs
description: The warehouse activity of picking items before they are shipped or consumed is performed in different ways, depending on how warehouse management features are configured. The [setup](../configure-warehouse-processes.md) complexity can rank from no warehouse features, through basic warehouse configurations for order-by-order handling in one or more activities only, to advanced configurations where all warehouse activities must be performed in a directed workflow.
