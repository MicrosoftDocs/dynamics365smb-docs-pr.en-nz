# <a name="adding-and-viewing-notes-on-records"></a>Adding and Viewing Notes on Records
 You <!--OnPrem and your colleagues -->can add notes to records in the application. Many pages, particularly those pages that display a list of records (such as the **Sales Orders** page) or details about a specific record (such as the **Sales Order** page) include the **Notes** action or **Notes** FactBox. **Notes** is where you can write notes about a record to yourself<!--OnPrem or others, and where you can view notes to you from others. For example, a note could be a general comment or processing instruction to your colleague, who can then respond to your note using their own **Notes**. Or, your colleague can add a note that gives you extra information about a sales order that is not covered by the information on the sales order. These notes and correspondences will follow the record as it is processed in the company.-->

<!--OnPrem
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can only select one recipient of the note.-->  
  
## <a name="to-work-with-notes-on-a-record"></a>To work with notes on a record 
  
1.  Open the record list page or record page (for example, the **Sales Orders** or **Sale Order** page).  
  
    <!-- If **Notes** is not visible on the page, then you can customize the page to display the Notes FactBox. -->
  
2.  Choose the **Notes** action to open the **Notes** window. This window displays any current notes on the record. From here, you can do the following:

    -   To view or edit the note, choose **...** and then **Edit**. You can also do this from the **Notes** FactBox if it available on the page.
    -   To add or note, choose **+new**, and the ype your message in the **Note** box. You can enter a maximum of 30 lines of text in the note. 
  
<!-- 5.  In the **To** field, enter a user ID (your own or someone elseâ€™s) to indicate who the note is for.  
  
6.  Select the **Notify** field if you want to send a notification to the user in the **To** field. 
  
     If **Notify** is selected, the note will be sent as a notification to the user's **My Notifications** on the Role Center.  -->
  
3.  Choose **OK**.
