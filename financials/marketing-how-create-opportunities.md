# <a name="how-to-create-sales-opportunities"></a>How to: Create Sales Opportunities
You can create opportunities for the sales opportunities you have on your contacts. All opportunities must be assigned to a salesperson or purchaser and must have a contact.

You can create opportunities from the **Opportunity List** window. But you typically will create opportunities from the specific contact or salespeople.

Before you can create opportunities, you must set up opportunity sales cycles. For more information see [How to: Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).
