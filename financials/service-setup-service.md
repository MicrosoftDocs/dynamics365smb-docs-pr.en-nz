# <a name="setting-up-service-management"></a>Setting Up Service Management
Before you can start using Service Management features in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], there are a few things to set up. For example, you can establish coding for standard services, symptoms, and fault codes, and the service items and service item types that your company's customer service needs require.  

When you set up Service Management, you must decide what services to offer customers and the schedule for those services. A service is a type of work performed by one or more resources and provided to a customer. For example, a service could be a type of computer repair. A service item is the equipment or item needing servicing, for example, the computer needing repair, installed at a specific customer. You can set up services as part of a group of related repair or maintenance items.  
  
When you define a service, you can associate it with the skills required to perform the service. To help your service representatives be efficient, you can also set up real time troubleshooting guidelines and assign typical startup costs, such as travel costs or other fees.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
