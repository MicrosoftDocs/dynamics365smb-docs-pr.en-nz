# <a name="general-business-functionality"></a>General Business Functionality
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] provides dedicated functionality for typical business areas, such as finance and sales. And to support your business area-specific tasks, you can use a variety of general business functionality, such as **Number Series** and **Extensions**, which is available across these areas.

The following table lists these general business areas with links to topics that describe them.

| To | See |
| --- | --- |
| Assign unique identification codes to records, such as general ledger accounts, customer and vendor accounts, invoices, and documents. A well-designed numbering system also makes the company more manageable and easy to analyse and can reduce the number of errors that occur in data entry. |[Creating Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md) |
| Set up standard text codes so you can extend standard text by adding extra lines, and set up conditions for use of the extra lines. |[How to: Define Extended Text](ui-how-define-ext-text.md) |
| Change [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] by installing extensions that add functionality, changes behavior, or gives you access to new online services. |[Customizing [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md) |
| Learn how to work with general journals, which are used to post to general ledger accounts and other accounts such as bank, customer, vendor, and fixed assets accounts. |[Managing General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md) |
| Communicate the contents of business documents quickly to your business partners, such as the payment information on sales documents to customers. |[How to: Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md) |
| Allocate an entry in a general journal to several different accounts when you post the journal. |[How to: Allocate Costs and Income](year-allocate-costs-income.md) |
| Schedule a report to run at a specific date and time. |[Schedule a report to run](ui-schedule-report.md) |
| Manage different types of report layouts. |[Managing Report Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md) |
| Request and grant approval to create or change certain documents and cards. |[Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md) |
| Record external documents in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], including their file attachments, and then manually create the related documents or automatically convert the files to electronic documents. |[Manage Incoming Documents](across-income-documents.md) |
