# <a name="project-management"></a>Project Management
In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can perform common project management tasks, such as configuring a job and scheduling a resource, as well as providing the information needed to manage budgets and monitor progress. You can track machine and employee hours on the project by using time sheets. As a project manager, you have a good overview, not only of individual jobs, but also of the allocation of employees, machinery and other resources being used in all projects.

Before you can use [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] to manage projects, you must set up resources, time sheets, and jobs. For more information, see [Setting Up Project Management](projects-setup-projects.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>   This functionality requires that your experience is set to **Suite**. For more information, see [Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

| Record job costs for resource usage, materials, and job-related purchases on an on-going basis and invoice the customer, either when the job is finished or according to an invoicing schedule. |[How to: Invoice Jobs](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md) |
