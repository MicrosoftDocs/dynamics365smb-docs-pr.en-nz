title: Balances Between Cost Type, Cost Centre, and Cost Object | Microsoft Docs
description: When you set up cost accounting, you must make sure that all entries are assigned to a cost type as well as a cost centre or a cost object. The means that each cost entry must have a cost type assigned and a cost centre code or a cost object assigned. This rule ensures that each cost entry appears in either the cost centres or the cost objects, but never in both places.
