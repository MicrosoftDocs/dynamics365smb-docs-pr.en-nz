# <a name="welcome-to-included365finlongincludesd365finlongmdmd"></a>Welcome to [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is a business management solution for small and mid-sized organizations that automates and streamlines business processes and helps you manage your business. Signing up is easy, and you can migrate existing business data from your legacy system.
When you sign up for the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] preview you get access to a demonstration company. The demonstration company contains sample data, but you can create your own sales documents, for example, or set up a bank account.  

## <a name="get-to-know-included365finincludesd365finmdmd"></a>Get to know [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]
In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], some things will be familiar to you, and other things might be unfamiliar. In the demonstration company, visual guides explain core functionality, and help you try out daily tasks like creating a sales invoice and viewing a report. If you leave a guide, for example, to explore [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] on your own, but want to return to it, go back to the Home page and launch the Getting Started tour.  

For some quick, nice-to-know tricks, see:  

* [Find things](ui-search.md)  
* [Searching, Filtering, and Sorting Lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md)  
* [Entering Data](ui-enter-data.md)  

For more information, see [Working with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]](ui-work-product.md).  

When you're ready to do some heavier lifting, and want to look at some of the business processes that [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] supports, see [Business Functionality](madeira-business-functionality.md). For an overview of current capabilities and what is coming, take a look at our roadmap at [roadmap.dynamics.com](https://roadmap.dynamics.com/#edition=1#application=a56e2c12-2a92-e611-80dc-c4346bac0910#status=3a708a86-ae97-e611-80df-c4346baceb68).  

## <a name="the-home-pages"></a>The Home pages
Home pages use a role-centric design to give you fast access to the business process and intelligence tools that you need to do your job. For example, an accountant can monitor payments and approvals, and view finance performance charts. Check out the various Home pages by choosing the **Settings** icon ![Settings](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") in the top right corner,  choosing **My Settings**, and then the Role Center to explore. Sign in again to apply the change. For more information, see [Changing the Role Center](change-role.md).  

Each Home page provides a **Setup and Extensions** button. Here you have access to a list of assisted setup that can help you get started by setting selected areas up quickly. If an area is not covered by an assisted setup, choose the **Manual Setup** action to access setup windows where you can fill in setup fields for all areas manually. For more information, see also [Setting Up [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]](setup.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>   The list of setup guides, extensions, and services that are available differ depending on the user experience you choose for your company. The **Basic** experience gives access to fewer than the **Suite** experience does. The first time you sign in, you use the Basic experience. For more information, see [Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).  

In the **Assisted Setup** window, you will find the following with the **Suite** experience:

| Assisted Setup | Description |

| Migrate Business Data |Lets you import your existing company data such as vendors, customers, and items from Excel or Quickbooks. |
| Set Up My Company |Creates a new trial company for you to enter data and try out [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. If you went through the Getting Started tour this is probably already **Completed**. |
| Set Up Cash Flow Forecast |Sets up the Cash Flow Forecast chart, so you can view the predicted movement of cash in and out of your business. The chart is available on the **Accountant Role Center**. |
| Set Up Approval Workflows |Sets up the ability to automatically notify an approver when a user tries to create or change certain values on documents, journal lines, or cards, such as an amount above a specified limit. |
| Set Up a Customer Approval Workflow |Sets up the ability to automatically notify an approver when a user tries to create or change a customer card. |
| Set Up Email |Gets you ready for sending email messages directly from, for example, sales orders or contacts in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. |
| Set Up Email Logging |Sets up the capability to log email correspondence in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] to follow up on interactions. |
| Set Up Outlook for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] |Sets up the ability to use and launch [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] from Outlook. |
| Set Up Reporting |Sets up data sets that you can use to build powerful reports using Excel or Power BI, for example. |
| Set Up an Item Approval Workflow |Sets up the ability to send a notification to an approver when a user changes or creates an item. |
| Set Up a Payment Approval Workflow |Sets up the ability to send a notification to an approver when a user sends payment journal lines for approval. |
| Set Up the Dynamics 365 Connector |Sets up a connection to Dynamics 365 for Sales, which allows you to synchronise data such as contacts and sales order information. |
| Set Up Sales Tax |Gets you started with default tax groups and assigning tax area codes that you can assign to customers and vendors in order to automatically calculate sales tax in sales or purchase documents. |

## <a name="trying-things-out-in-your-own-company"></a>Trying things out in your own company
Thinking about subscribing? You can easily change from the demonstration company, and create and work in a company of your own. This is a great way to start toward a subscription. Setups for finances are provided; you just need to create or import your customers, vendors, and the products or services that you sell. After that, you're ready to post invoices and use business intelligence tools to analyse your business. You can use your company for free for a 30-day trial period. If you subscribe to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] during that time, you're already up and running. You can continue with the work you did during the trial.  

To create a company to try things out, go to the **My Settings** menu in the top right corner, and change the company to **My Company**. Sign out of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and then sign in again to apply the change. An assisted setup guide will help you provide basic information about your company. When that's done, explore the Home page and find the **Assisted Setup** action.  

## <a name="ready-to-subscribe"></a>Ready to subscribe?
Each time you sign in during the trial period, a notification in a blue bar at the top displays the time remaining. If you decide to subscribe, use the link in the notification to get in touch with Microsoft. You can also contact the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Sales team at [Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Financials](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828707).
