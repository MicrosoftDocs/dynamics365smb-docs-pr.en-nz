# <a name="searching-filtering-and-sorting-data"></a>Searching, Filtering, and Sorting Data
There are a few things that you can do that will help you find, pinpoint, and scan records in a list. These include sorting, searching and filtering.

When you want to search for data, such as customer names, addresses, or product groups, you enter criteria. In search criteria you can use all the numbers and letters that you normally use in the specific field. In addition, you can use special symbols to further filter the results. There are two ways to search: using the Quick Filter or column filters.

## <a name="sorting"></a>Sorting
Sorting makes it easy for you to get a quick overview of your data. If you have many customers, for example, you can choose to sort them by **Customer No.**, **Customer Posting Group**, **Currency Code**, **Country Region Code**, or **US Sales Tax Registration No.** to get the overview you need.

To sort a list, you can either choose a column heading text to toggle between ascending and descending order, or choose the small downs arrow in the column heading, and then choose **Ascending** or **Descending**.  

> [!NOTE]  
>   Sorting is not supported images, BLOB fields, FlowFilters, and fields that do not belong to a table.  

## <a name="searching-by-using-the-quick-filter"></a>Searching by using the Quick Filter
You can add filters to all pages by using the Quick Filter. The Quick Filter is enabled by choosing the magnifier icon in the top right corner of a page. This filtering type is used for a fast entry of criteria.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   The Quick Filter provides an easy access to filter data by entering plain text, but does also provide a lot of search criteria options. Depending on whether you enter plain text or text including symbols, the Quick Filter behaves differently.  

* If you enter plain text in the search criteria, the search criteria is interpreted as a case insensitive search that contains certain text.  
* If you enter text including symbols in the search criteria, the search criteria is interpreted exactly as you entered it, and the search is case sensitive.

### <a name="quick-filter-criteria"></a>Quick filter criteria
<!-- html syntax because symbols conflict with MarkDown syntax -->
<TABLE>
  <TR>
    <TH>Search Criteria</TH>
    <TH>Interpreted as...</TH>
    <TH>Returns...</TH>
  </TR>

    <TD>man</TD>
    <TD>@&#42;man&#42;</TD>
    <TD>All records that contain the text <b>man</b> and case insensitive.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>se</TD>
    <TD>@&#42;se&#42;</TD>
    <TD>All records that contain the text <b>se</b> and case insensitive.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Man&#42;</TD>
    <TD>Starts with <b>Man</b> and case sensitive.</TD>
    <TD>All records that start with the text <b>Man</b>.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>'man'</TD>
    <TD>An exact text and case sensitive.</TD>
    <TD>All records that match <b>man</b> exactly.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>@man* </TD>
    <TD>Starts with and case insensitive.</TD>
    <TD>All records that start with <b>man</b>.</TD>
  </TR>
    <TR>
    <TD>@&#42;man</TD>
    <TD>Ends with and case insensitive.</TD>
    <TD>All records that end with <b>man</b>.</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>

> [!NOTE]  
>   You cannot use a wildcard when filtering on enumeration fields, such as the **Status** field on sales orders. To enter a filter for this type of field, you can enter the numeric value as a filtering parameter. For example, in the **Status** field on a sales order that has the values **Open**, **Released**, **Pending Approval**, and **Pending Prepayment**, use the values **0**, **1**, **2**, and **3** to filter for these options. 

## <a name="searching-by-using-column-filters"></a>Searching by using column Filters
You can add a filter on one or more columns in a list. Filtering on columns is more flexible and enhanced than the Quick Filter. 

### <a name="to-add-a-filter-on-a-column"></a>To add a filter on a column
1.  Before you add a filter, choose ![Show as list](media/ui_show_as_list_icon.png "Show as list arrow left") icon to change to the list view.
2. Choose the downwards arrow in the column heading, and then choose **Filter**.
3. Do one of the following: 
  -  Choose *...* next to the box to select a value from a list.
  -  Enter filter criteria in the box. See the next section for details.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

## <a name="filter-criteria-and-symbols"></a>Filter criteria and symbols
When you enter criteria, you can use all the numbers and letters that you can normally use in the field. In addition, you can use special symbols to further filter the results. The following tables show the symbols which can be used in filters.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  There may be instances where field values contain these symbols and you want to filter on them. To do this, you must include the filter expression that contains the symbol in quotation marks (''). For example, if you want to filter on records that start with the text *S&R*, the filter expression is **'S&R*'**.
