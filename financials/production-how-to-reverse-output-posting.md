# <a name="how-to-reverse-output-posting"></a>How to: Reverse Output Posting
There are times when output posting must be reversed. An example of this would be if a data entry error occurred and an incorrect amount of output is posted to a production order.  

## <a name="to-reverse-an-output-posting"></a>To reverse an output posting  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link. Select your batch.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [How to: Batch Post Output and Run Times](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).
3.  In the **Applies-To Entry** field, select the associated item ledger entry. This reverses the capacity and item ledger entries.  
4. Post the reversal by posting the journal.  

The output journal entries are posted to the item ledger as a positive adjustment.
