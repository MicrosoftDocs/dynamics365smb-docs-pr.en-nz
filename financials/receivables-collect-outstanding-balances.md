# <a name="how-to-collect-outstanding-balances"></a>How to: Collect Outstanding Balances
Managing receivables includes checking whether amounts due are paid on time. If customers have overdue payments, you can send the Customer Statement report as a reminder.

**Note**: If you are using multiple currencies, the Customer Statement report is always printed in the customer's currency. The last date in a statement period is also used as the statement date and the ageing date, if ageing is included.

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon"), enter **Customer Statement**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Under **Output Options**, select how to send the report to the customer.
