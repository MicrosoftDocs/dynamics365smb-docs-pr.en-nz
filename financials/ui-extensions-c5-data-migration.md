# <a name="the-c5-data-migration-extension-for-finance-and-operations-business-edition"></a>The C5 Data Migration Extension for Finance and Operations, Business edition
This extension makes it easy to migrate customers, vendors, items, and your general ledger accounts from Microsoft Dynamcis C5 2012 to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. You can also migrate historical entries for general ledger accounts.

> [!Note]
> The company in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] must not contain any data. Additionally, after you start a migration, do not create customers, vendors, items, or accounts until the migration finishes.

##<a name="what-data-is-migrated"></a>What Data is Migrated?
The following data is migrated for each entity:

**Customers**
* Location
* Country
* Customer dimensions (department, centre, purpose)
* Shipment method
* Sales Person
* Payment terms
* Payment method
* Customer price group
* Customer invoice discount

If you migrate accounts, the following data is also migrated:

* Customer posting setup
* General journal batch
* Open transactions (customer ledger entries)

**Vendors**
* Location
* Country
* Vendor dimensions (department, centre, purpose)
* Invoice discount
* Shipment method
* Purchaser

* Vendor invoice discount

If you migrate accounts, the following data is also migrated:

**Items**
* Location
* Country
* Item dimensions (department, centre, purpose)
* Sales line discounts
* Customer discount groups

> [!Note]
> If there are open transactions that use foreign currencies, the exchange rates for those currencies are also migrated. Other exchange rates are not migrated.

## <a name="to-migrate-data"></a>To migrate data
There are just a few steps to export data from C5, and import it in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]:  

1. In C5, use the **Export Database** feature to export the data. Then send the export folder to a compressed (zipped) folder.  
2. In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Data Migration**, and then choose **Data Migration**.  
3. Complete the steps in the assisted setup guide. Make sure to choose **Import from Microsoft Dynamcis C5 2012** as the data source.  

> [!Note]
> Companies often add fields to customise C5 for their specific line of business. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] does not migrate data from custom fields. Also, migration will fail if you have more than 10 custom fields.

## <a name="viewing-the-status-of-the-migration"></a>Viewing the Status of the Migration
Use the **Data Migration Overview** page to monitor the success of the migration. The page shows information such as the number of entities that the migration will include, the status of the migration, and the number of items that have been migrated and whether they were successfull. It also shows the number of errors, lets you investigate what went wrong and, when possible, makes it easy to go to the entity to fix the issues. For more information, see the next section in this topic.  

> [!Note]
> While you are waiting for the results of the migration, you must refresh the page to display the results.

## <a name="correcting-errors"></a>Correcting Errors
If something goes wrong and an error occurs, the **Status** field will show **Completed with Errors**, and the **Error Count** field will show how many. To view a list of the errors, you can open the **Data Migration Errors** page by choosing:  

* The number in the **Error Count** field for the entity.  
* The entity, and then the **Show Errors** action.  

On the **Data Migration Errors** page, to fix an error you can choose an error message, then choose **Edit Record** to open a page that shows the migrated data for the entity. After you fix one or more errors, you can choose **Migrate** to migrate only the entities you fixed, without having to completely restart the migration.  

> [!Tip]
> If you have fixed more than one error, you can use the **Select More** feature to select multiple lines to migrate. Alternatively, if there are errors that are not important to fix, you can choose them and then choose **Skip Selections**.

> [!Note]
> If you have items that are included in a BOM, you might need to migrate more than once if the original item is not created before the variants that reference it. If an item variant is created first, the reference to the original item can cause an error message.  

## <a name="verifying-data-after-migrating"></a>Verifying Data After Migrating
One way to verify that your data migrated correctly is to look at the following pages in C5 and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].

|Microsoft Dynamcis C5 2012 | [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]|
|-----|-----|
|Customer Entries| General Journals|
|Vendor Entries| General Journals|
|Item Entries| Item Journals|

In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], the batch for the migrated data is named **C5MIGRATE**.

## <a name="stopping-data-migration"></a>Stopping Data Migration
You can stop migrating data by choosing **Stop All Migrations**. If you do, all pending migrations are also stopped.
