You can import master data and some transactional data from other finance systems based on the default configuration package in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. In the **Configuration Packages** window, you can work with the package to import and validate the data before you apply the package.  

If you are familiar with RapidStart Services for Microsoft Dynamics, you are also familiar with configuration packages. The default configuration package supports the most common types of data that you want to import from a legacy system. In Excel, you can then add the data from the legacy system and set it up according to the business logic of the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  

> [!TIP]  
>   Alternatively, use data migration wizards to import data from QuickBooks or Dynamics GP. For more information, see [QuickBooks Data Migration](ui-extensions-quickbooks-data-migration.md) or [Dynamics GP Data Migration](ui-extensions-dynamicsgp-data-migration.md).  

## <a name="working-with-data-in-excel"></a>Working with Data in Excel
When you export the default configuration package to Excel, the generated workbook contains a worksheet for each table in the package. To simplify your tasks, you can take advantage of the XML manipulation tools that are built into Excel. You can also use Excel built-in functions to help with data formatting and to put data in the correct cell. For example, add a blank worksheet and copy the legacy data to it. Then make an Excel formula to map data in the transformation worksheet between the fields in the exported worksheet and customer legacy data. After you have mapped all of the data, copy the range of data onto the table worksheet.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Do not change the columns in the worksheets. If they are moved, changed, or deleted, the worksheet cannot be imported into [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].

## <a name="importing-customer-data"></a>Importing Customer Data
After the customer data has been entered in Excel, you import the data into [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. In the **Configuration Packages** window, you import the data from the Excel file, and you can validate that the data is consistent with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] before you apply the package.
