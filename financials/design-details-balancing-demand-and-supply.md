To understand how the planning system works, it is necessary to understand the prioritised goals of the planning system, the most important of which are to ensure that:  

- Any demand will be met by sufficient supply.  
- Any supply serves a purpose.  

 Generally, these goals are achieved by balancing supply with demand.
