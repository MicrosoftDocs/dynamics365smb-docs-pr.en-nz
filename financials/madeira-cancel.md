# <a name="unsubscribe-remove-or-reset-included365finincludesd365finmdmd"></a>Unsubscribe, Remove, or Reset [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]
When you have signed up for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can choose to cancel your subscription at any time. Similarly, you can choose to reset the company that you can been using in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. For a quick overview, see [the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] blog](https://community.dynamics.com/business/b/financials/archive/2016/11/28/how-long-is-the-trial-period-and-how-do-i-cancel).  

## <a name="unsubscribing-by-removing-included365finincludesd365finmdmd-from-your-office-365-experience"></a>Unsubscribing by removing [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] from your Office 365 experience
If you have subscribed for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] using an existing Office 365 business account, you must ask your Office 365 administrator to remove the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] licence from your user account.  
User accounts and licenses are managed in the [Office Portal](https://portal.office.com). Only administrators can remove [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] licenses from user accounts. The Office 365 administrator can remove [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] from your user account or remove the subscription from your company's account. If [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is removed from your user account, and other people from your company continue the subscription, they will still have access to your shared data in the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] company.  

## <a name="unsubscribing-from-included365finincludesd365finmdmd-without-office-365"></a>Unsubscribing from [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] without Office 365
If you signed up for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] using a non-Office 365 business account, you do not have an Office 365 administrator. Instead, you must unsubscribe by contacting the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Cancelation team. Currently, you must contact the team by sending an email message at cancel-madeira@microsoft.com. You must include the name of your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] tenant in the message so that we can identify you. The easiest way to do that is to copy the URL from your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Home page.  

## <a name="resetting-your-included365finincludesd365finmdmd-experience"></a>Resetting your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] experience
If you have added data to your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] preview and you want to start over with a fresh experience, you can create a new company and then reset the first company. If you open the **Companies** page, you can create a copy of your current company, sign out and then sign into your new company, and then reset the original company.  
> [!NOTE]  
>   When you reset a company that you are sharing with other people from your organisation, you must make sure other people are not logged in when you reset the company.

If you want to hide [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] from your app launcher, you can quite simply unpin it. This does not remove any data, and it does not cancel your subscription.
