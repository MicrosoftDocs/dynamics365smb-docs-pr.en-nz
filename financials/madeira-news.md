# <a name="whats-new-in-dynamics-365-for-finance-and-operations-business-edition"></a>What's New in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Business edition
Welcome to [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]! If you haven't already, then sign up for a trial, let us walk you through the basics of what you can do with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], and then try things out on your own for a while. When you are ready, you can open a blank company and set things up for yourself.  

On a regular basis, we will update [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] with additional capabilities in the core application and with new [extensions](ui-extensions.md). For an overview of what is coming and what is currently available, see the [Dynamics 365 Roadmap](https://roadmap.dynamics.com/) - and remember to filter for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  

On this page, you can see which areas became available while we were still in preview. Going forward, find the updates in the [Dynamics 365 Roadmap](https://roadmap.dynamics.com/).

## <a name="november-2016-launch-of-included365finlongincludesd365finlongmdmd"></a>November 2016 Launch of [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]
As announced on the blog, we're now a service that you use in your business. But this update also adds new capabilities and a new extension.

### <a name="project-management"></a>Project management
If you switch to the Suite experience, you can manage projects and work with resources, time sheets, and jobs. When you first log in as a Project Manager role, an assisted setup guide will help you set up how your projects are managed. You can work with the sample accounts, jobs, resources, and so on in the demonstration company to get familiar with the functionality. For more information, see [Managing Projects](projects-manage-projects.md).

### <a name="fixed-assets"></a>Fixed assets
If you switch to the Suite experience, you can manage fixed assets, including depreciation and insurance. A standard setup is provided, but you can modify it if anytime you want. You can register purchases of fixed assets in dedicated fixed asset G/L journals where you can also dispose of fixed assets. The right accounting entries are created automatically. For more information, see [Fixed Assets](fa-manage.md).

### <a name="new-extension-for-migrating-data-from-dynamics-gp"></a>New extension for migrating data from Dynamics GP
If your business uses Dynamics GP today, you can use an assisted setup guide to migrate master records to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. You must have exported your existing customers, vendors, inventory items, and accounts using the export data functionality in Dynamics GP. The Dynamics GP Data Migration extension automatically maps the exported data so that you can quickly get  your existing data into your new company in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. For more information, see [Dynamics GP Data Migration](ui-extensions-dynamicsgp-data-migration.md).

### <a name="cash-flow-forecasting"></a>Cash flow forecasting
The charts on the Accountant Role Centre provide insight that can help you make solid decisions about what to do with your cash. Also, you can use the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart to generate predictions of your cash flow in the future. For more information, see [Analyzing Cash Flow in Your Company](finance-analyze-cash-flow.md).

### <a name="team-members"></a>Team members
The **Team Member** Role Center is a new role center that is defined for the Dynamics 365 team member role so that these users can read and modify most data in the system. As a team member, you can also work with timesheets and approval tasks that they are assigned.

### <a name="synchronize-your-customers-and-services-with-bookings-in-office-365"></a>Synchronise your customers and services with Bookings in Office 365
With this update, you can automatically synchronise your customer and service item records with the new **Bookings** app in Office 365. You'll create customers and services and book appointments in Bookings, and these then show up in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. Just like that, you'll have invoiced the customer following the service automatically - and you won't have entered the same information twice in the process.

## <a name="september-2016-update"></a>September 2016 Update
This update of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] added new capabilities as [announced on the blog](https://community.dynamics.com/business/b/financials/archive/2016/09/29/new-and-updated-capabilities-in-the-september-update-of-project-quot-madeira-quot).

### <a name="more-flexibility-in-your-sales-processes"></a>More flexibility in your sales processes
This update adds more flexibility in what you sell:
- You can now set up nonstock items - items that you offer to customers but do not maintain inventory for. For more information, see [How to: Work with Nonstock Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).
- You can now mark an item for drop shipment on a sales order and immediately create a purchase order for the item. This way, you can sell an item to a customer, purchase it from the vendor, and have it shipped directly from your vendor to your customer. For more information, see [How to: Purchase Items for a Sale](purchasing-how-purchase-products-sale.md).

### <a name="categorize-items-in-your-inventory"></a>Categorise items in your inventory
With this update, you can create a hierarchy of item categories and assign item attributes to each item category. For more information, see [How to: Categorize Items](inventory-how-categorize-items.md).

### <a name="send-purchase-orders-to-vendors"></a>Send purchase orders to vendors
Now you can enter purchase orders within [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. For more information, see [How to: Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

### <a name="better-quality-incoming-documents"></a>Better quality incoming documents
You can now easily correct errors in the scanned documents before you receive the resulting document - this way, you'll train the service to avoid the errors going forward. For more information, see [How to: Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Document](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md).

## <a name="august-2016-update"></a>August 2016 Update

### <a name="smart-notifications-give-you-advice-and-recommendations"></a>Smart notifications give you advice and recommendations
With this update, you'll notice such notifications display when you create a sales invoice for a customer that has an overdue balance, or when the amount in the sales document exceeds the credit limit specified for the customer, for example. For more information, see [Smart Notifications](ui-smart-notifications.md).  

### <a name="introducing-the-new-sales-and-inventory-forecast-extension"></a>Introducing the new Sales and Inventory Forecast extension
In this update, we introduce the new Sales and Inventory Forecast extension that gives you insights about potential sales and a clear overview of expected stock-outs. The extension uses [Cortana Intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/what-is-cortana-intelligence-suite) to predict future sales based on your sales history to help you avoid inventory shortage. For more information, see [Sales and Inventory Forecast](ui-extensions-sales-forecast.md).  

###  <a name="smarter-sales-and-purchase-documents"></a>Smarter sales and purchase documents
We've made several small but important improvements to sales and purchase documents:
- You can cancel posted credit memos
- Sales invoices include Package Tracking No. and Shipping Agent Code

- You can substitute items

### <a name="working-with-incoming-documents-in-outlook"></a>Working with incoming documents in Outlook
This update adds actions to the vendor dashboard in the Outlook add-in so you can work directly with attachments to the associated email. You use the actions to send the email attachments directly to the **Incoming Documents** list, send the documents to the OCR service, and send an approval request for the incoming document. For more information, see [Manage Incoming Documents](across-income-documents.md).

Then, you can create and send an invoice for the services provided in the meeting - all of this happening right there in the Outlook calendar.
