# <a name="connecting-power-bi-to-finance-and-operations-business-edition-content-packs"></a>Connecting Power BI to Finance and Operations, Business edition Content Packs
Getting insights into your Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] data is easy with Power BI and the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] content packs. Power BI retrieves your data then builds an out-of-the-box dashboard and reports based on that data.

> [!NOTE]  
>  You must have a valid account with Dynamics 365 and with Power BI. Also, you must download [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/).  
>  Power BI content packs require permissions to the tables where data is retrieved from. More details on the requirements are described below.  

## <a name="how-to-connect"></a>How to Connect
1. Select **Get Data** at the bottom of the left navigation pane.  
![Navigating to Get Data](./media/across-how-to-connect-powerbi-d365-content-packs/powerbi-get-data.png)
2. In the **Services** box, select **Get**. This will open a window with the **AppSource** and **Apps for Power BI apps**.

## <a name="system-requirements"></a>System Requirements

## <a name="web-services"></a>Web Services
An easy way to find the web services is to search for web services in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. In the list make sure the Publish box is marked for the web services listed above.

## <a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting
The Power BI dashboard relies on the published web services that are listed above, and it will show data from the demonstration company or your own company if you import data from your current finance solution. However, if something goes wrong, this section provides a workaround for the most typical issues.

### <a name="incorrect-company-name"></a>Incorrect Company Name  
A common mistake is to enter the company display name instead of the company name. To find the company name search for **Companies**. Then use the **Name** field when entering your company name.

### <a name="incorrect-user-name-and-password"></a>Incorrect User Name and Password  
The user name and password used to connect will be the same as what is used to connect to your Microsoft Office 365 account.  

The content packs also require that you have a Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] account. Once you enter your credentials, we will auto discover any Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] tenants you have access to. If you do not have a licensed or trial Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] account, you will receive an error message.

### <a name="the-key-didnt-match-any-rows-in-the-table"></a>The Key Didn't Match Any Rows in the Table
If you enter a non valid company name during the connection process, you may get the error message "The key didn't match any rows in the table". Provide the correct company name and try connecting again.
