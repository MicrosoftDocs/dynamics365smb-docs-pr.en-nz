# <a name="how-to-use-time-sheets-for-jobs"></a>How to: Use Time Sheets for Jobs
You use the **Create Time Sheets** batch job to set up time sheets for a specified number of time periods or weeks. You must have permissions to be able to create time sheets.

You can copy and use your job planning lines in a time sheet. In that way, you must only enter the information in one place and the line information is always correct.

After you have approved time sheet entries for a job, you can post them to the relevant job journal or resource journal.

Before you can use time sheets, you must set up general information and specify an administrator and one or more approvers of time sheets. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

> [!NOTE]  
>   This functionality requires that your experience is set to **Suite**. For more information, see [Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).

## <a name="to-reuse-time-sheet-lines-in-other-time-sheets"></a>To reuse time sheet lines in other time sheets
If your time sheet information remains the same from time period to time period, you can save time by copying the lines from the previous time period. Then, you just enter your time usage for the new period.

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the time sheet for a period later than the period for an existing time sheet with lines.

The lines are copied, including details such as type and description. For example, if the line is related to a job, the **Job No.** is copied. All copied lines have the status **Open**. You can now modify the lines as needed.

## <a name="to-fill-in-a-time-sheet-lines-and-submit-for-approval"></a>To fill in a time sheet lines and submit for approval

7. Choose the **OK** button.
