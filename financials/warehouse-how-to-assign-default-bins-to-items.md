# <a name="how-to-assign-default-bins-to-items"></a>How to: Assign Default Bins to Items
If you are using bins at a location, assigning default bins to your items can make the process of shipping, receiving, and moving your items much easier. When a default bin is assigned to an item, this bin is suggested every time you initiate a transaction for this item. Default bins are defined in the **Bin Content** window.  

## <a name="to-assign-a-default-bin-to-an-item"></a>To assign a default bin to an item
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Bin Content Creation Worksheet**, and choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in the bin code and item information for each bin that you would like to set up as a default for an item. Make sure to select the **Default** field.  
3.  Choose the **Create Bin Content** action. Default bins are now assigned for your item.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When an item is put away, if the item does not have a default bin assigned, the bin where the item is put away is assigned as the default.  

## <a name="to-change-the-default-bin-for-an-item"></a>To change the default bin for an item  
You may need to change the default bin assignment for an item or assign a default bin to a new item.    
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Bin Contents**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Location Filter** field, select the appropriate location code.  
3.  Find the current default bin content entry for the item and clear the **Default Bin** check box.  
4.  Find the bin content line for the bin that you would like as the new default bin. Select the **Default Bin** check box.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When an item is put away for the first time, and the item does not have a default bin assigned, the system will assign the bin where the item is put away as the default bin for the item.
