# <a name="set-up-statuses-for-service-orders-and-repairs"></a>Set Up Statuses for Service Orders and Repairs
You must set up repair status options that identify the progress of repair and maintenance of service items in service orders. You must set up at least nine repair status options that identify situations or actions taken when servicing service items.  

You can set the priority level for service order status options. There four priorities are High, Medium High, Medium Low, and Low.  
  
When you change the repair status of a service item in a service order, the service order status is updated. The repair status of each service item is linked to the service order status. If the service items are linked to two or more service order status options, the service order status with the highest priority is selected.  

## <a name="to-set-up-a-repair-status"></a>To set up a repair status  
1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Repair Status**, and then choose the related link. 2. Create a new repair status.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. In the **Service Order Status** field, choose the order status to link the repair status to. The **Priority** field displays the priority of the service order status you have chosen.  
5. Choose a repair status. You can choose only one.
