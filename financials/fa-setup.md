# <a name="setting-up-fixed-assets"></a>Setting Up Fixed Assets
Before you can work with Fixed Assets, you need to define a few things:  

* How you insure, maintain, and depreciate fixed assets.  
* How you record costs and other values in the general ledger.  

The table below has links to more information. After you set those things up, you can start various activities. For more information, see [Fixed Assets](fa-manage.md).  

**Note**: You can record fixed asset transactions in the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** or **Fixed Asset Journal** windows, depending on whether the transactions are for financial reporting or for internal management. Help for Fixed Assets only describes how to use the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** window.  

When you enable a fixed asset activity in the **G/L Integration** section in the **Depreciation Book Card** window, the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** window is used to post transactions for the activity.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
