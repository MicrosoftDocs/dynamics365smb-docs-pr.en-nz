# <a name="how-to-set-up-warehouse-employees"></a>How to: Set Up Warehouse Employees
Each user who performs warehouse activities must be set up as a warehouse employee assigned to one default location and potentially more non-default locations. This user setup filters all warehouse activities across the database to the employee's location so that the employee can only perform the warehouse activities at the default location. A user can be assigned to additional non-default locations for which the employee can view activity lines but not perform the activities.

## <a name="to-set-up-warehouse-employees"></a>To set up warehouse employees  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Select the **User ID** field, and then select the user to be added as a warehouse employee. Choose the **OK** button.  
6.  In the **Location Code** field, enter the code of the location where the user will be working.  
7.  Select the **Default** check box to define the location as the only location where the employee can perform warehouse activities.  
8.  Repeat these steps to assign other employees to locations or assign non-default locations to existing warehouse employees.
