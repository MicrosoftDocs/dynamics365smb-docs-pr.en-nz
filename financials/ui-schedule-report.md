# <a name="schedule-a-report-to-run"></a>Schedule a Report to Run
You can schedule a report to run at a specific date and time. Scheduled reports are entered in the job queue and processed at the scheduled time, similar to other jobs. You can choose to save the processed report to a file, such as an Excel, Word, or PDF, print it to a selected printer, or process the report only. If you choose to save the report to a file, then the processed report is sent to the **Report Inbox** area on your Home page, where you can view it.

You can schedule a report when you open a report. You choose the **Schedule** action and then you enter information such as printer, and time and date. The report is then added to the job queue and will be run at the specified time. When the report is processed, the item will be removed from the job queue. If you saved the processed report to a file, it will be available in the **Report Inbox** area.
