# <a name="how-to-set-up-a-loaner-program"></a>How to: Set Up a Loaner Program
Sometimes you must provide a customer a loaner item for use when your customer service team makes a repair. In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can set up a loaner programme, loan items to your customers, and track receipts when customers return the items. Additionally, you can add comments about loaners in one of two ways:  
  
* Enter a note or comment about the loaner itself.  
* Enter a note on a service item about the need for a loaner.  

## <a name="to-set-up-a-loaner"></a>To set up a loaner  
1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Loaners**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new loaner card. 
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the loaner. Alternatively, if you have set up number series for loaners in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window, you can press the Enter key to enter the next available loaner number.  
4. Fill in the **Description**, **Description 2**, and **Serial No.** fields.  
5. In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, choose the relevant unit of measure.
