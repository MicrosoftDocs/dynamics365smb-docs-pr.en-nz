# <a name="how-to-add-contacts-to-segments"></a>How to: Add Contacts to Segments
After you have created a segment and entered basic information about it, you may want to add contacts to the segment. You can do this by filling in the lines in the **Segment** window manually, but it is easier and faster to use the **Add Contacts** action.

## <a name="to-add-a-contact-to-a-segment"></a>To add a contact to a segment
1. On the Home page, choose **Active Segments**. Or, choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Segments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the segment, and then choose the **Add Contacts** action. The **Add Contacts** batch job window opens.
3. In the **Contact** section, set filters to specify the information by which you want to select contacts.

To enter additional filters, repeat this procedure on each of the remaining sections, and then choose the **OK** button.

If you have added contacts by mistake and want to go back one step, then choose the **Go Back** action.

## <a name="to-refine-the-number-of-contacts"></a>To refine the number of contacts
After you have selected the contacts within a segment, you may decide to remove some but keep others. You can manually remove contacts from the lines in the **Segment** window, but it is easier and faster to use the **Refine Contacts** action.

1. Open the segment.
2. Choose **Contacts**, and then choose the **Refine Contacts** action. The **Remove Contacts - Refine** window opens.
3. In the **Contact** section, enter filters to specify the information that you want to use to select the contacts to be removed from the segment.
4. Add additional filters as needed, and then choose the **OK** button.

You can refine a segment as many times as you want. If you have refined the segment by mistake and want to go one step back, choose the **Go Back**.

To see a list of the segment criteria that you have used, in the **General** section, choose the **No. of Criteria Actions** field.

## <a name="to-reduce-the-number-of-contacts"></a>To reduce the number of contacts
After you have selected the contacts within a segment, you may want to remove some of them. You can do this by manually removing them from the lines in the Segment window, but it is easier and faster to use the Reduce Contacts function to specify which contacts to remove, and to use the Refine Contacts function to specify which contacts to keep.

1. Open the segment.
2. Choose Contacts, and then choose the **Reduce Contacts** action. The **Remove Contacts - Reduce** window opens.
3. In the **Contact** section, enter filters to specify the information that you want to use to select the contacts to be removed from the segment.
4. Add additional filters as needed, and then choose the **OK** button.

You can reduce a segment as many times as you want. If you have refined the segment by mistake and want to go one step back, then choose the **Go Back** action.
