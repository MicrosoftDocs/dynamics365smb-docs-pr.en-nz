To account for salary payments and related transactions, you must import and post financial transactions made by your payroll provider to the general ledger.

To do this, you first import a file that you receive from the payroll provider into the **General Journal** window. Then you map the external accounts in the payroll file to the relevant G/L accounts. Lastly, you post the payroll transactions according to the account mapping. For more information, see [How to: Import Payroll Transactions](finance-how-import-payroll-transactions.md).

The Quickbooks Payroll File Import extension allows you to import payroll transaction from the Quickbooks Payroll service.
