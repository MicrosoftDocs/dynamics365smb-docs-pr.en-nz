# <a name="set-up-email-manually-or-using-the-assisted-setup"></a>Set Up Email Manually or Using the Assisted Setup
To send and receive emails from within [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you must fill in the fields on the **SMTP Mail Setup** page.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Instead of entering the SMTP server details, you can use a function to enter them with information from your Office 365 subscription.

You can either set email up manually or you can get help by using the **Email Setup** assisted setup. For more information, see [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).  

## <a name="to-set-up-email"></a>To set up email
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **SMTP Email Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Alternatively, choose the **Apply Office 365 Server Settings** action to insert any information that is already defined for your Office 365 subscription.
4. When all the fields are correctly filled in, choose the **Test Email Setup** action.
5. When the test succeeds, close the page.
