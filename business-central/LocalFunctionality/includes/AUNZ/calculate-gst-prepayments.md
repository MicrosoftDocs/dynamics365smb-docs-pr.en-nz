When a partial payment or prepayment is made, you must calculate Goods and Services Tax (GST) for that partial payment or prepayment based on the total invoice amount, instead of on a partial amount. If you account for GST on a non-cash basis, you must report and pay GST on payments during the period in which you receive partial payment or issue a tax invoice for payment.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](../../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup** , and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Local Functionalities** FastTab, select the **Full GST on Prepayment** check box to calculate GST for the total invoice amount when a prepayment invoice is posted.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.
