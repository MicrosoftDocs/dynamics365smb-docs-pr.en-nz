You can reallocate the amount in one general ledger account to other general ledger accounts so that the balances of your accounts remain proportionate to one another.  

Use the **Calculate Distribution Amount** function to calculate the allocation percentage based on the balances of the accounts or based on the net changes between the accounts. Run the **Calculate Distribution Amount** function from the **Allocation** page for the Standard Balance and Reverse Balance recurring methods in the **Recurring Journal**.  

The net changes or balances of the accounts on the **Allocation** page determine the allocation percentage calculated.
