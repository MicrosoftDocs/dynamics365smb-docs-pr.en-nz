Withholding tax (WHT) is the tax withheld by a company when it makes a payment to a vendor, in which the full amount owed to the vendor is reduced by the tax withheld. The withheld tax is then remitted to tax authorities when the next Business Activity Statement (BAS) is submitted.  

If a supplier without a New Zealand Inland Revenue Department number (IRD) provides an invoice, a withholding tax amount must be withheld if the total amount of the invoice is more than the threshold amount.  

To use withholding tax, you must set up the business posting groups and product posting groups for withholding tax so that the correct WHT calculations are made for each vendor.  

> [!NOTE]  
> As a prerequisite, you need to set up source codes for WHT settlement on the **Source Code Setup** page.  

The following procedure describes how to set up product posting groups for WHT, but the same steps also apply to setting up business posting groups for WHT.
