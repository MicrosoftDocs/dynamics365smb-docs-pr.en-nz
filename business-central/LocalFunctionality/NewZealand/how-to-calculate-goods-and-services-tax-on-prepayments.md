# <a name="calculate-goods-and-services-tax-on-prepayments"></a>Calculate Goods and Services Tax on Prepayments
When a partial payment or prepayment is made, you must calculate Goods and Services Tax (GST) for that partial payment or prepayment based on the total invoice amount, instead of on a partial amount. If you account for GST on a non-cash basis, you must report and pay GST on payments during the period in which you receive partial payment or issue a tax invoice for payment.
