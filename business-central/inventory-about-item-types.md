# <a name="about-item-types"></a>About Item Types
In the **Type** field on the **Item Card** page, you can select what the item is used for in your business and therefore how it is managed in the system. Three options exist:

|Option|Typical Purpose|
|------|-----------|
|Inventory|A physical unit, such as a bicycle, for full business support.|
|Non-Inventory|A physical unit, such as a bolt, for limited business support, for example, because the item is only used internally and has a low cost.|
|Service|A labour time unit, such as a consultancy hour, for limited business support.|

The **Inventory** type involves full tracking of inventory quantity and value. Therefore, all item transaction types are supported, and items of type Inventory can be used with all item-handling features.

The **Service** and **Non-Inventory** types do not involve tracking of inventory quantity and value. Therefore, only selected item transaction types and features are supported.

The three item types support the following features respectively.

|Item Type|Sales|Purchasing|Job Consumption|Service Consumption|Assembly Consumption|Production Consumption|Assembly Output|Production Output|Location Transfer|Physical Counting|Inventory Revaluation|Inventory Costing|Item Tracking|Reservation|Warehousing|Planning|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Inventory|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Non-Inventory|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|
|Service|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|

> [!NOTE]
> Items that you offer to your customers but you do not want manage in your system until you start selling them can be set up as catalogue items. Catalogue items are not to be mistaken with regular items of type Non-Inventory. For more information, see [Work with Catalogue Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Customers' items that you perform service on, such as a printer, are called service items. Service items have nothing to do with regular or catalogue items. However, service components can be regular items. For more information, see [Set Up Service Items and Service Item Components](service-how-setup-service-items.md).
