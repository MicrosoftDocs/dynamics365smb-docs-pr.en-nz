# <a name="walkthrough-of-inbound-and-outbound-flow-in-mixed-warehouse-configurations"></a>Walkthrough of inbound and outbound flow in mixed Warehouse Configurations

This walkthrough demonstrates how to complete inbound and outbound flows in mixed configuration, where for inbound flow warehouse is configured as Basic: Order-by-Order and for outbound flow Advanced configuration is used. For more information, see [Overview of different configuration options](../../design-details-warehouse-management.md#overview-of-different-configuration-options).

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
To complete this walkthrough, you need to make yourself a warehouse employee at *YELLOW* location by following these steps:  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **User ID** field, and select your own user account on the **Users** page.  
3. In the **Location Code** field, enter *YELLOW*.

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], the inbound processes for receiving and putting away can be performed in four ways using different functionalities depending on the warehouse complexity level.  

|Method|Inbound process|Bins|Receipts|Put-aways|Complexity level (See [Design Details: Warehouse Setup](../../design-details-warehouse-setup.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|----------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|X|||2|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document|||X|3|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document||X||4/5/6|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document||X|X|4/5/6|  

For more information, see [Design Details: Inbound Warehouse Flow](../../design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).  

The following walkthrough demonstrates method C in the previous table.  

### <a name="scenario"></a>Scenario
Alicia, the purchasing agent, creates purchase orders for various roasted beans as demand appears. When combined delivery arrives at the warehouse, John, the warehouse worker, receives and puts the items away. When John posts the receipt, the items are posted as received into inventory and available for sale or other demand.  

### <a name="steps"></a>Steps
1. Set up the **Location Card** page to define the company's inbound warehouse flows.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  Open the *YELLOW* location card.  
    3.  Disable the **Require Put-away** toggle.  

2. Release Purchase Orders to warehouse.  

    1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
    2. Select orders from vendor 10000 for the YELLOW location. Vendor Orders No are *Y-1* and *Y-2*. Use the personalisation tools if the **Vendor Order No.** field isn't visible. For more information, see [Personalise Your Workspace](../../ui-personalization-user.md).
    3. Choose the **Release** action to notify the warehouse that the selected purchase orders are ready for warehouse handling when the delivery arrives.  

3. Create the Warehouse Receipt to receive and put the delivered items away
    1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts** and choose the related link.

    1. Select line with item *WRB-1000*.
    2. Select *OVERRCPT10* in the **Over-Receipt Code** field and change value in the **Quantity to Receive** field from *100* to *110*.

## <a name="outbound-flow-picking-and-shipping-in-advanced-warehouse-configurations"></a>Outbound flow: Picking and Shipping in Advanced Warehouse Configurations

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], the outbound processes for picking and shipping can be performed in four ways using different functionalities depending on the warehouse complexity level.  

|Method|Inbound process|Bins|Picks|Shipments|Complexity level (See [Design Details: Warehouse Setup](../../design-details-warehouse-setup.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|----------|-----------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post pick and shipment from the order line|X|||2|  
|B|Post pick and shipment from an inventory pick document||X||3|  
|C|Post pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document|||X|4/5/6|  
|D|Post pick from a warehouse pick document and post shipment from a warehouse shipment document||X|X|4/5/6|  

For more information, see [Design Details: Outbound Warehouse Flow](../../design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).
