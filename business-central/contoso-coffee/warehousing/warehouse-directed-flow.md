2. Choose the **User ID** field, and select your own user account on the **Users** page.  
3. In the **Location Code** field, enter WHITE.  
4. Enable the **Default** toggle.


## <a name="scenario"></a>Scenario
Ellen, the warehouse manager utilises cross-dock and bin replenishment functionality to speed up receiving and shipping time.  

## <a name="steps"></a>Steps

1. Create Warehouse Shipment.  

    1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
    2. Select order for customer 10000 for the WHITE location. External Order No is *W-1*.
    3. Choose the **Create Warehouse Shipment** action to create warehouse shipment for selected sales order.
    4. Choose the **Release** action to notify the warehouse that the sales shipment is ready for warehouse handling.  

2. Define bins for the item to control where it is put-away 

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  Select the *WRB-1000* and then choose the **Bin Contents** action.  
    3.  Choose the **New** action. Add two lines.
    
    |Item|Location code|Bin Code|Fixed|Unit of Measure|
    |----------|----------|---------|---|------|  
    |WRB-1000|WHITE|W-05-0001|Yes|BAG|  
    |WRB-1000|WHITE|W-05-0002|Yes|BAG|

3. Create Warehouse Receipt.  

    1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
    2. Select order from vendor 10000 for the WHITE location. Vendor Order No is *W-2*. Use the personalisation tools if the **Vendor Order No.** field isn't visible. For more information, see [Personalise Your Workspace](../../ui-personalization-user.md).
    3. Choose the **Create Warehouse Receipt** action to create warehouse receipt for selected purchase order.


4. Check if there are outgoing orders that need received items and post receipt
    1. Choose the **Calculate Cross-Dock** action. This will populate a column **Qty. to Cross-Dock**.
    2. Enter 0 into the **Qty. to Cross Dock** field in the line with item *WRB-1000* as you don't plan to repack in the receiving area.
    3. Choose the **Post Receipt** action.

5. Register the Warehouse Put-Away
    1. Using the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 5.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Put-Away** and choose the related link.
    2. Locate the warehouse put-away document created from your Warehouse Receipt and open it
    3. On the **Warehouse Put-Away** page, review the **Lines** section

    At this stage, the bin capacity logic is revealed. the warehouse put-away lines will have three lines for item *WRB-1000*:
    - A Take line to move the received quantities from the receiving bin (W-08-0001)
    - A Place line that will move a one BAG into the one of configured fixed bins (W-05-0001)
    - A Place line that will move another BAG into another fixed bins (W-05-0002). This is because single fixed bin can't contain the full receipt quantity.

    Because this put-away contains cross-dock lines, youâ€™ll see three  lines for item *WRB-1001*:
    -  A Take line to move the received quantities from the receiving bin (W-08-0001)
    -  A Place line for the 2 into the cross-dock bin
    -  A Place line for the remaining quantity in storage bin

    4. Choose the **Register Put-away** action.


6. Define a pick bins for the item to control where it is picked from 

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 6.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  Open the *WHITE* location card.  
    3.  Choose the **Bins** action in the **Location Card**
    4.  Select the bin *W-02-0001*, and then choose the **Contents** action.  
    5.  Choose the **New** action.  
    6.  Enable the **Fixed** toggle.  
    7.  In the **Item No.** field, enter *WRB-1000*. 
    8.  In the **Min Qty.** field, enter *2*. 
    9.  In the **Max Qty** field, enter *10*. 

    Use the personalisation tools if the **Min Qty.** and **Max Qty.** fields aren't visible. For more information, see [Personalise Your Workspace](../../ui-personalization-user.md). 

7. Reorganise warehouse by moving items from bulk storage area to picking area, to optimise picking time.

    1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 7.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Movement Worksheets** and choose the related link
    2. Choose the **Calculate Bin Replenishment** action. 

    The warehouse worksheet with proposal on moving item *WRB-1000* from bulk storage to pick area is created.

    3. Choose the **Create Movement** action and confirm to create the document.
    4.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 8.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Movements** and choose the related link
    5.  Open the warehouse movement you created, review the **Lines** section

     At this stage, the break-bulk functionality is revealed. There will be four lines:
    - A line to Take the one BAG out bulk storage bin
    - A line to Place the 48 PCS back into stock in the same bin. 
    - A line to Take the 10 PCS out bulk storage bin
    - A line to Place the 10 PCS into the picking bin

    6.  Choose the **Register Movement** action.

8. Create warehouse picks

    1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 9.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Pick Worksheets** and choose the related link
    2. Choose the **Get Warehouse Documents** action, select the line for the sales order for customer 10000, and then choose the **OK** button to fill the worksheet lines according to the selected document.

    3. Inspect the **Qty. on Cross-Dock Bin** field. 

    4. Choose the **Create Pick** action.
    5. Confirm any of the pick settings needed, for example, enable **Per From Zone** toggle. Choose the **OK** button.
    
    You'll receive a confirmation message with the pick numbers. There are two picks as some items are located in the cross-dock zone, close to shipping area, and it would make sense to process them separately.

9.  Register the warehouse picks
    1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 10.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Picks** and choose the related link.
    2. Locate the picks you created and open it.
    3. Choose the **Register Pick** action.
    4. Repeat for the second pick

    1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 11.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Shipment** and choose the related link.
    2. On the warehouse shipment page, review the **Lines** section. After the warehouse pick is registered, the warehouse shipment will be updated with the **Qty. to Ship** populated.
    3. Choose the **Post Shipment** action.
    4. Confirm the **Ship** option.
