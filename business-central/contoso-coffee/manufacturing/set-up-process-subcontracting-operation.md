In this article, we take you through the steps to use the Contoso Coffee demo data in subcontracting.

## <a name="scenario"></a>Scenario

You are the production planner at Contoso Coffee. Due to capacity constraints, you plan to use a subcontractor to produce the item **SP-SCM1009, Airpot**.

Here, you create a new released production order for 12 units of item SP-SCM1009, Airpot, using Routing - SP-SCM1009-SUB-2. Use the subcontracting worksheet to generate a purchase order for the production, and then finish the operation by receiving and invoicing the purchase order.
