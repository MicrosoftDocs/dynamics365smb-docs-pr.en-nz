In this article, we take you through the steps to use the Contoso Coffee demo data to manually set up a new production routing in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

Oscar, the process engineer, at Contoso Coffee, decides to create a new routing with the name *New Path*. Because this routing is unlike any other routing at Contoso Coffee, Oscar must manually enter all of the information for the routing.
