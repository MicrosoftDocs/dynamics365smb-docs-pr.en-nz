In this article, we take you through the steps to use the Contoso Coffee demo data to work with production orders.  

## <a name="scenario"></a><a name="scenario"></a><a name="scenario"></a>Scenario

Eduardo, the production planner at Contoso Coffee, must create a new production order for 10 units of the item **SP-SCM1009, Airpot** that must be due on April 28. Eduardo backward schedules this and confirms that they can start the order on April 27.  

Shortly after finishing this task, Eduardo is asked to increase the order to 50 units. On doing this, the backward scheduling functionality pushes the order start date too early. So Eduardo forward schedules the order from April 23 in order to determine a more realistic finish date.  

## <a name="steps"></a><a name="steps"></a><a name="steps"></a>Steps

1. Create the initial production order for 10 units of the item **SP-SCM1009, Airpot**.

    1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **firm planned prod. orders**, and then choose the related link.  

    2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

        |Field  |Value  |
        |---------|---------|
        |**Source Type** |Item|
        |**Source No.** |SP-SCM1009|
        |**Quantity** |10|
        |**Due Date**|April 28  |

    3. Choose the **Refresh Production Order** action.  

    4. On the **Refresh Production Order** page, accept all defaults, and then choose the **OK** button to start the process.  

        In the current setup, this process uses backwards scheduling. In the new line on the production order, the starting date is April 26.  

2. Change the production order's quantity to 50 units and schedule the order.  

    1. On the **Lines** FastTab of the **Production BOM**, select the recently added line, and then, in the **Quantity** field, enter *50*.  

3. Choose the **Refresh Production Order** action.  

    The start date has now been pushed back to April 20. This is not an acceptable date for Eduardo.

4. Trigger a forward scheduling of the production order.

    1. On the **Schedule** FastTab, set the **Starting Date** field to *April 23*.

    The starting for the order is now April 25, and the ending date is May 2. The due date for the order is set one day later, May 3. Eduardo now knows that it will take until May 3 to deliver the increased order.

> [!NOTE]
> Scheduling an order by changing its starting or ending date does not require the **Refresh Production Order** batch job because all dates recalculate automatically.

The new production order is now set up, and Eduardo's requirements are met.
