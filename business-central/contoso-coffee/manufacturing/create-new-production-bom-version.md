In this article, we take you through the steps to use the Contoso Coffee demo data to work with bills of material (BOM) in production processes.  

## <a name="scenario"></a><a name="scenario"></a>Scenario

Contoso Coffee has decided to add another coffee maker to their product line: **SP-SCM1008 Airpot Lite**. This coffee maker is identical to the existing item **SP-SCM1009 Airpot**, except that it does not include the warming plate, **SP-BOM1104**. In a separate step, the on/off light, **SP-BOM1106** is removed for a version of the Airpot Lite BOM.

Oscar, the process engineer at Contoso Coffee, must set up a new production BOM to define the initial component requirements for the Airpot Lite. Oscar must then set up a new BOM version, with a start date of July 01, to align with further plans on releasing another edition.

## <a name="steps"></a><a name="steps"></a>Steps

1. Create a new production BOM for the Airpot Lite.

    1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **production BOM**, and then choose the related link.

        |**No.** |SP-SCM1008|
        |**Description** |Airpot Lite|
        |**Unit of Measure Code**|PCS  |

2. Copy the BOM components from production BOM **SP-SCM1009**.

    1. Choose the **Copy BOM** action.

    2. In the **Production BOMs** page, choose the line for **SP-SCM1009, Airpot**, and then choose the **OK** button.

3. Change the components for the new production BOM as described in the scenario.

    1. On the **Lines** FastTab, select the line for the item **SP-BOM1104**, and then choose the **Delete Line** action.  

4. Certify the new BOM.  

    1. In the **Status** field, choose *Certified*.  

5. Create a production BOM version for the Airpot Lite.

    1. Choose the **Versions** action.

    2. On the **Prod. BOM Version List** page, choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as described in the following table.

        |**Unit of Measure Code**|PCS  |  
        |**Starting Date**|July 01  |  

6. Copy the component lines from the production BOM into the new BOM version.

    1. Choose the **Copy BOM** action, and then choose the **Yes** button to copy the components from the original production BOM.

7. Remove the item **SP-BOM1106, On/off light** from  the version components.
