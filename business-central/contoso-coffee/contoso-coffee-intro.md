Contoso Coffee is a fictitious company that produces consumer and commercial coffee makers. The **Contoso Coffee** apps for Business Central add demo data that you can use to learn how to use the capabilities in Business Central.  


## <a name="set-up-contoso-coffee-data"></a><a name="set-up-contoso-coffee-data"></a>Set up Contoso Coffee data

To use the Contoso Coffee demo data, you must install two apps in the relevant company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]:  

- **Contoso Coffee Demo Dataset**  

    This app delivers demo data for the base application.  
- **Contoso Coffee Demo Dataset (country ID)**  

    This app adds country-specific content on top of the base application.

Add the apps to an empty company in a paid subscription or as part of a trial. For example, create a new company with no sample data from the **Create New Company** assisted setup guide that you can open from the **Companies** list. Then add the apps from the [marketplace](../ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md#install) if they are not already listed in the **Extension Management** page.  

You then should complete:
 - The [Manufacturing Setup](manufacturing/contoso-coffee-manufacturing-intro.md) to prepare for use of the [Manufacturing Scenarios](#manufacturing-scenarios)
 - The [Warehousing Setup](warehousing/contoso-coffee-warehousing-intro.md) to prepare for use of the [Warehousing Scenarios](#warehousing-scenarios)

## <a name="warehousing-scenarios"></a><a name="warehousing-scenarios"></a>Warehousing Scenarios

The Contoso Coffee demo data currently supports the following warehousing scenarios for test and training:

1.  Configure default bins, receive and put-away with inventory put-away, pick and ship with inventory pick in order-by-order fashion with [Walkthrough of inbound and outbound flow in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehousing/warehouse-basic-flow-putaway-pick.md)
2.  Receive and put-away multiple inbound orders at once with warehouse receipt, ship multiple orders at once with warehouse shipment, pick with warehouse picks with [Walkthrough of inbound and outbound flow in mixed Warehouse Configurations](warehousing/warehouse-mixed-flow-receive-pick-ship.md)
3.  Configure fixed bins for item unit of measure, user cross-docking to reduce physical movements of goods, optimise placing of goods with bin replenishment, break-bulk large units of measure into smaller ones, distribute picking among warehouse employes with picking worksheet with [Walkthrough of inbound and outbound flow in Advanced Warehouse Configuration with Directed Put-away and Pick](warehousing/warehouse-directed-flow.md)
