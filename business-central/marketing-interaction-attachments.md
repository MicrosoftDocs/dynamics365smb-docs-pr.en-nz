# Attachments for Interactions

The files that are attached to interactions aren't attached to the interaction directly. They come from one of the following places:

* The interaction template that you used to create the interaction. Learn more about setting up templates, go to [Set up interaction templates](marketing-interactions.md#set-up-interaction-templates).
* The segment that you created the interaction for. To learn more about segments, go to [Manage Interactions for Segments](marketing-interaction-segments.md).

## View attachments

Attachments are available when you view recorded interactions on the **Interaction Log Entries** page. Choose the **Show Attachments** action.

## Types of files you can attach

Attachments can be just about any type of file, such as Word documents, Powerpoint presentations, Excel or text files, and so on.

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with Word, which lets you use features such as merge fields on Word templates. To learn more about using Word templates, go to [Use Word Templates for Bulk Communication](ui-mail-merge.md).

## What you can do with attachments

You can do the following things with attachments:

* **Open**: You can start the associated program, for example Microsoft Word, and the document opens. You can then modify it.
* **Import**: You can import all kinds of attachments. For example, you can scan a received letter, import it and attach it to the interaction that records the reception of that letter.
* **Export**: You can export attachments to a location on a disk file.
* **Remove**: You can remove the current attachment from an interaction template.
* **Copy**: You can copy attachments from another interaction template.
