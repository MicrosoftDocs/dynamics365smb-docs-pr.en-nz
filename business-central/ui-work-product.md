# <a name="work-with-"></a>Work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

While you're working in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you interact with data in different ways. For example, you create records, enter data, sort and filter data, write notes, and export data to other applications.

There are lots of ways to customise the appearance of pages: 

* Adjust the size and position of any page
* Expand the width of columns and increase the height of column headers
* Change how you sort data in columns. 

If you want to use the horizontal scroll bar to view all columns on a list page or on document lines, there's a vertical freeze pane to keep some columns from scrolling.

## <a name="choosing-a-desktop-browser"></a>Choosing a desktop browser

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports multiple browsers, and each browser offers various features. The browser plays a significant role in the responsiveness and fluidity of the user interface. Check out the list of supported, recommended browsers for [Business Central online](./product-requirements.md) and browsers for [Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/system-requirement-business-central-v15).

- Where possible, avoid older browsers such as Internet Explorer. Instead, switch to one of our recommended modern browsers, such as the [new Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/).  

    > [!NOTE]
    > Internet Explorer is no longer supported. To learn more, go to [Microsoft Edge documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/hub/4337664/microsoft-edge-help).
- Keep your browser up to date with the latest version.

## <a name="action-bars"></a>Action bars

Inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you do most of your work in a list, a document, or a card. All pages have a bar with actions that are relevant to them. The actions are almost the same for the individual card or document and the list of entities. This way, you can manage an individual sales order in the **Sales Order** page and in the **Sales Orders** list, including posting it and invoicing it.  

How you open a page and the context of what you're doing affect whether actions are available. Actions can appear differently, not be available, or even not be present. Not all actions are relevant, or supported, for all processes. Also, some actions require that you make a selection. If an action isn't relevant or supported, we make them unavailable. We do that to help clarify what you can do with your selections.

Specifically for list pages, the list page that you open from the home page and the page that opens when you use the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon to search for it aren't identical.  

When you search for and open a list page, such as the **Sales Orders** list, it's in view mode. The actions for editing, viewing, or deleting an individual entity, such as a sales order, are shown when you choose the **Manage** action.  

> [!TIP]
> If you know that you'll often use actions on the second level of the action bar, choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/pin.png" border="false"::: icon to pin the action bar and make the actions under the various menus immediately discoverable.
>
> To hide the second level of the action bar again, choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/unpin.png" border="false"::: icon.

When you open the same list page from your home page, the **Manage** action isn't available. Instead, to open an individual sales order, choose the **Number** field. In this view, you can't pin the action bar.
