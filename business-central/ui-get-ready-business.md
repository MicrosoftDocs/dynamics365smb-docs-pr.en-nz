# <a name="getting-ready-for-doing-business"></a>Getting Ready for Doing Business
Congratulations, you have just initiated your first company in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].

To help you get ready for doing business, you can visit the **Business Assistance** page where you can launch assisted setup guides, videos, or help topics for selected setup tasks. You access the page from the chart on the **Business Manager** Role Centre by choosing the **Business Assistance** drop-down, and then choosing the **Show Setup and Help Resources** action. When you refresh the page, the chart is replaced with the setup and help resources.

On the Role Centre, in the navigation bar at the top, you will find the **Setup and Extensions** menu. Here you have access to a list of assisted setup guides that can help you get started. Once you have migrated data, such as vendors, customers, and items from your existing financial system, you are ready to begin. But depending on your needs, consider if the other assisted setup can help you. If an area is not covered by an assisted setup, choose the **Manual Setup** action to access setup pages where you can fill in setup fields for all areas manually. For more information, see also [Setting Up [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]](setup.md).

> [!NOTE]  
>   The list of assisted setup guides, extensions, and services that are available differ depending on the user experience you choose for your company. The **Essential** experience gives access to fewer than the **Premium** experience does. The first time you sign in, you use the **Essential** experience. For more information, see [Changing Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).

When you have run an assisted setup guide, it is marked as **Completed**. To run the assisted setup guide, you choose the three dots also called the context menu, and then you select **Start Setup**.

## <a name="role-center"></a>Role Centre
On the Role Centre, you have an overview of the business. To the left you see a navigation bar that gives you easy access to customers, vendors, items, and so on. In the centre you find the **Activities** tiles. **Activities** show current data and can be clicked or tapped for easy access to the selected document. The **Key Performance Indicators** can be set up to display a selected chart for a visual representation of, for example, cash flow or income and expenses. You can also build up a list of **Favourite Customers** on the Role Centre for accounts that you do business with often or need to pay special attention to.
Use the arrows to collapse part of the page and make more room to show specific data. At the top of the Role Centre you will find all of the actions that can be applied to the current content. This too can be collapsed and you only need to click or tap within the collapsed area to view it again.

> [!TIP]  
> You can get back to the Role Centre by selecting the company name in the upper left corner.

## <a name="company-information"></a>Company Information
Under **Company Settings** you can view and edit setup information about the current company, much of this was prefilled if you completed the **Set Up Company** assisted setup when signing up for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. If you want to change the company logo, contact information, bank settings, or tax information, you can do it from this page.    

## <a name="adding-users-and-permissions"></a>Adding Users and Permissions
If you need to add more users, this is done from Office 365 Admin Centre. For more information, see [Add Users to Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-users-to-Office-365-for-business-435ccec3-09dd-4587-9ebd-2f3cad6bc2bc). Once users are created in Office 365, they can be imported into the **Users** page by using the **Get Users from Office 365** action. You can then proceed to assign permissions to users and to organise them in user groups. For more information, see [Managing Users and Permissions](ui-how-users-permissions.md).  

## <a name="getting-help"></a>Getting Help
In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] you will find tooltips that can help guide you through the various business processes. For each field tooltip, you can press Ctrl+F1 or choose the **Learn more** link to open Help for the page in question. The question mark in the upper right corner also points you to product Help.

## <a name="next-steps"></a>Next Steps
Based on your migrated data, you can now proceed to create new sales or purchase documents. Use the **My Company** section of your **Home** page to quickly create a new sales quote, sales invoice, sales order, purchase invoice, or payment registration.
