# <a name="delete-approval-workflows" />Delete Approval Workflows

If you're certain a workflow is no longer being used, you can delete it. All workflow step instances defined in the workflow must have a **Completed** status.

> [!CAUTION]
> When you delete a workflow, all information in the workflow is lost.

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code.
