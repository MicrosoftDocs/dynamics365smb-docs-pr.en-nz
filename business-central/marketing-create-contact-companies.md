When you develop a business relationship with someone in another company, add them as a contact in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Then, add any information about them, or their company, that could be useful in future communications. You can create the following types of contacts on the **Contact Card** page:

* **Person** – Use this when you've had direct contact with someone and have their contact details.
* **Company** – Use this for a contact that is not an individual person but rather an entity such as a contractor or a bank.

The information that's relevant for each type of contact differs, so the available fields and actions are different. For example, you can only assign job responsibilities to a person, and an industry group to a company.

You can change the value of the **Type** field later. Alternatively, use the fields on the **Inheritance** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page to specify the data to share between a person and their company. Learn more at [Setting Up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).

When a contact is converted to a customer, for example, the contact person or contact company becomes the name of the customer. The record for the contact is kept, and you can link the contact and the customer so their data is synchronised going forward.

> [!NOTE]
> If you switch on the [feature update for conversion templates](/dynamics365-release-plan/2020wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/use-conversion-templates-convert-contacts-vendors-employees), then you can also create vendors or employees from business contacts.
>
> However, if you're already using the built-in functionality to create customers or items automatically, this feature update does not support custom fields, and newly created customers or items will not include such data.

## <a name="to-create-a-contact-manually"></a><a name="to-create-a-contact-manually"></a><a name="to-create-a-contact-manually"></a>To create a contact manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the contact.

   Alternatively, if you have set up a number series for contacts on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to insert the next available contact number.
4. Fill in the remaining fields as required. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

If you have existing customers, vendors, and bank accounts you want to create contact cards for, you can use the **Create Contacts from** batch jobs. When you create a contact this way, the contact information is later synchronised with the related customer, vendor, or bank account information. Learn more at [Synchronising Contacts with Customers, Vendors, Employees, and Bank Accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can create contacts based on existing data, you must specify a business relation code for customers, vendors, or bank accounts on the **Interactions** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page. Learn more at [Set up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter one of the following that matches the entity you want to create contacts from, then choose the related link.
   * **Create Contacts from Customers**
   * **Create Contacts from Vendors**
   * **Create Contacts from Bank Accounts**
2. On the request page that opens, in the **Customer**, **Vendor**, or **Bank Account** section, set filters if you want to create contacts from specific customers, vendors, or bank accounts.
3. Choose **OK** to start creating contacts.

The next contact numbers in the number series are assigned to the new contacts. The business relation code specified on the **Marketing Setup** page is assigned to the newly created contacts.

> [!TIP]  
> You can also do this the other way around, namely by creating a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact. Learn more in the [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.

If you have a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account for the company you want to create a contact for, use the **Create as** action. When you create a contact this way, the contact information is later synchronised with the related customer, vendor, employee, or bank account information. Learn more at [Synchronising Contacts with Customers, Vendors, and Bank Accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).<!--Should this link include "Employees" as per the section title below?-->

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can create customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from contacts, you must specify a business relation code on the **Marketing Setup** page on the **Interactions** FastTab. Learn more at [Setting up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the contact you want to create as a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account.
3. Choose the **Create as** action, then choose either **Customer**, **Vendor**, **Bank**, or **Employee**.
4. Choose **OK**.

The contact information is transferred from the contact card to a new customer, vendor, employee, or bank account card. You may want to add specific information to each of the cards, such as invoicing and payment details. For an example, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

## <a name="to-link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account"></a><a name="to-link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account"></a><a name="to-link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account"></a>To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account

If you have a contact and either a customer, vendor, employee or bank account for the same company, you can link the two entities to synchronise data.

1. Open the contact you want to link.
2. Choose the **Link with existing** action, then choose the **Customer**, **Vendor**, **Bank**, or **Employee** action.
3. On the page that opens, select the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account to link to.
4. In the **Current Master Fields** field, specify the fields to prioritise if there is conflicting information in fields common to both the existing contact and the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account. So, if the salesperson code differs between the contact and customer, you can choose to keep the one on the contact card by selecting **Contact**.
5. Choose **OK**.

If you linked a contact with a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account that you didn't intend to, remove the link between the entities so the data no longer synchronises.

1. Open the contact that has the wrong link.  
2. Choose the **Business Relations** action.  
3. On the page that opens, select the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account to remove the link from.  
4. Choose the **Delete** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Do not use the **Business Relations** window to change existing relations. Instead, remove the relation and use the **Link with existing** action. Learn more in the [To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account) section.

If some of your contacts are also customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts, you can synchronise them with data from the contact and gain the following benefits:

* You only have to update information in one place. So, if you modify the phone number on the contact, the phone number for the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account is automatically updated.
* If you have specified a number series for contacts, when you create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account card, a contact is automatically created.
* You can create sales quotes and orders, and purchase quotes and orders, from the contact.
* You can record your interactions, such as printing orders, blanket orders, creating sales service orders, sending e-mails, and so on.
* If you delete a contact linked to a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account, only the contact is removed. The customer, vendor, employee, or bank account remains.
* Likewise, if you delete a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account that is linked to a contact, the contact remains.

> [!NOTE]  
> Certain details, such as invoicing and posting details, are not available for contacts. When you create contacts as customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts, you may want to add that information manually.

There are three ways to enable data synchronisation between contacts and customers, vendors, employees or bank accounts:

* When you create contacts from customers, vendors, or bank accounts. Learn more in the [To create a contact from a customer, vendor, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-contact-from-a-customer-vendor-or-bank-account) section.
* When you create customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from contacts. Learn more in the [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.
* When you link contacts to existing customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from the contact card. Learn more in the [To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account) section.
