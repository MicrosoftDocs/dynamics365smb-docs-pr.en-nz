# Create projects

When you start a new project, you must create a project card with integrated project tasks and project planning lines, structured in two layers.  

The first layer consists of project tasks. You must create at least one project task per project because all posting refers to a project task. Having at least one project task in your project enables you to set up project planning lines and to post consumption to the project.

The second layer consists of project planning lines, which specify the detailed use of resources, items and various general ledger expenses.

The layer structure enables you to divide the project into smaller tasks, and therefore use more specific details in budgeting, quotes, and registration. In addition, it gives you insight into how a project is progressing. For example, you can track whether you're meeting designated milestones or if you're on target to meet budget expectations.

> [!TIP]
> Choose the **New Project** action on the **Project Manager** Role Centre to launch an assisted setup guide that takes you through the steps of creating a project with integrated tasks and planning lines. The following procedure describes how to perform the steps manually. <!-- For an example of how to create a project manually, go to [Video: How to create a project in Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqaPWr7BWmw).-->

## Invoice one or more customers for project tasks

Sometimes the party that is receiving a service is different from the party that'll pay the bill. Also, sometimes you might need to invoice multiple customers for tasks in the project. On the **Project Card** page, use the **Task Billing Method** field to specify whether you're billing one customer, or multiple customers.

If the customer who is receiving the service will also pay the bill, in the **Bill-to** and **Ship-to** fields, choose **Default (Customer)** and **Default (Sell-to Address)**.

If you're billing multiple customers, you can specify the customer who will receive the service and the customer to invoice for each task in the project. You can also provide the following information:

* Where the work will happen by selecting from a list of ship-to addresses for the customer.
* Add information about external references to simplify communication about the project.
* Overwrite the standard financial terms of the project.

## Invoice one customer for multiple project tasks

You can simplify your invoicing process by sending one invoice to a customer for multiple projects. Add project planning lines from multiple projects to a sales invoice in one go. This process is similar to creating a sales invoice from a project planning line and entering a value in the **Append to Sales Invoice No.** field.

Here's an overview of the process.

1. Create a new sales invoice, and fill in the **Sell-to Customer No.** field. If needed, also fill in the **Bill-to Customer No.** and **Currency Code** fields.
2. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Project Planning Lines** action. The **Get Project Planning Lines** page shows billable project planning lines from projects for the sell-to customer, bill-to customer, and invoicing currency where the quantity to invoice is more than zero. 
3. Choose the lines you want to add to the invoice, and then choose **OK**.

Repeat these steps if you want to add another set of project planning lines. You can also delete the invoice or its lines and start over.

> [!NOTE]
> There are a couple of limitations:
>
> * The **Get Project Planning Lines** action isn't available on sales orders or sales quotes.
> * You can't filter on the **Ship-to Code** or **Contact No.** fields.

## To create a project card

You create a project card and then create project task lines and project planning lines for it.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To base the project on information from another project, choose the **Copy Project** action, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are using time sheets with your project, you must also designate a person responsible. This person can approve time sheets for the employee tasks associated with the project. For more information, see [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

Optionally, mark actions on project as blocked using the **Blocked** field. the following table describes the effect of the options for this field.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Blank |All actions are allowed.|
|Posting    |You can work with planning lines, but the project is blocked for posting. Choosing this option means that you cannot post any usage or sale on the project.|
|All  |All actions are blocked.|

## To create tasks for a project

A key part of creating a project is to specify the various tasks involved in the project. You specify tasks by creating one line per task on the **Tasks** FastTab on the **Project Card** page. Every project must have at least one task.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the project card for a relevant project.
3. On the **Tasks** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary on a new line.
4. To indent tasks and create a hierarchy, Choose the **Tasks** action, the then choose **Indent Project Tasks** action.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the tasks that you need for the project.
6. To specify the project tasks with information on other project tasks, choose the **Copy Project Tasks from** action, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

## To create planning lines for a project

You can refine your new project tasks on project planning lines. A planning line can capture the information that you want to track for a project. For example, you can track the resources the project requires, or the items that are needed. For example, you have a task to get a customer to approve a project. You associate the task with planning lines for items such as meeting the customer and assigning a resource.  

A project planning line can have one of the following types.  

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Budget** |Provides estimated usage and costs for the project, typically in a time and materials type project. You can't invoice planning lines of this type. |
| **Billable** |Provides estimated invoicing to the customer, typically in a fixed price project. |
| **Both Budget and Billable** |Provides budgeted usage equal to what you want to invoice. |

> [!NOTE]
> While you enter information on project planning lines, cost information is automatically filled in. For example, the cost, price, and discount for resources and items are based on information from the resource and item.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project card.
3. Select a project task for which the **Project Task Type** field contains **Posting**, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
4. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all planning lines that you need for the project task.
