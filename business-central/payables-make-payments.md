# <a name="making-payments"></a>Making Payments

When you make payments to vendors or customers, or reimburse your employees, you post the related payment lines in the **Payment Journal** window. The payment journal is a general journal that is optimised for making payments and includes a number of powerful functions such as the **Suggest Vendor Payments** function that finds vendor payments that are due, and the **Vendor - Summary Ageing** report that shows an overview of due vendor payments.  

You can start the process of making the payment from the lists, cards, and ledger entries for vendors, customers, and employees. Each of these pages has a button that starts the payment flow and helps you fill in the payment journal.  

From the payment journal, you can print computer cheques or record when cheques are written. If you select **Computer Cheque** in the **Bank Payment Type** field, then any lines representing cheques must be printed before the payment journal can be posted.

When the payments are posted, you can export them to a bank file for upload to your bank for processing.

After the payments are made at your bank, you must apply them to their related open vendor or employee ledger entries. You can do this manually or by importing a bank statement file and applying the payments automatically. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
