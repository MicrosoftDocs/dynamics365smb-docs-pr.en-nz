# <a name="making-payments"></a>Making Payments
When you make payments to vendors or reimbursements to employees, you post the related payment lines in the **Payment Journal** window. You can use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** function to find vendor payments that are due. You can also use the **Vendor - Summary Ageing** report to get an overview of due vendor payments.

From the payment journal, you can print computer cheques or record when cheques are written. If you select **Computer Cheque** in the **Bank Payment Type** field, then any lines representing cheques must be printed before the payment journal can be posted.

When the payments are posted, you can export them to a bank file for upload to your bank for processing.

After the payments are made at your bank, you must apply them to their related open vendor or employee ledger entries. You can do this manually or by importing a bank statement file and applying the payments automatically. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
