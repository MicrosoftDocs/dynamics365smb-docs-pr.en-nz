# Make payments

You pay vendors or customers, or reimburse your employees, by posting payment lines on the **Payment Journal** page. The payment journal is a general journal that's optimised for making payments, and offers lots of powerful actions. For example, the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action that finds vendor payments that are due, and the **Vendor - Summary Ageing** report that shows an overview of due vendor payments.  

You can start the payment process from the lists, cards, and ledger entries for vendors, customers, and employees. Each of these pages has a button that starts the payment flow and helps you fill in the payment journal.  

From the payment journal, you can print computer cheques or record when cheques are written. If you select **Computer Cheque** in the **Bank Payment Type** field, you must print lines that represent cheques before you can post the payment journal.

After you post payments, you can export them to a bank file you can upload to your bank for processing.

After the payments are made at your bank, you must apply them to their related open vendor or employee ledger entries. You can apply them manually or by importing a bank statement file and applying the payments automatically. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.
