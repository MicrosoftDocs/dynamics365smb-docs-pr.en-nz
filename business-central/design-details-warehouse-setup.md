title: Design Details - Warehouse Setup | Microsoft Docs
description: Warehouse functionality in Business Central contains different levels of complexity, as defined by licence permissions in the offered granules. The level of complexity in a warehouse solution is largely defined by the bin setup on location cards, which in turn is license-controlled so that access to bin setup fields is defined by the license.
