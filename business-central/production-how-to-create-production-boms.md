title: How to Create Production BOMs | Microsoft Docs
description: A production BOM holds master data that describes the components and subassemblies used in the production of a parent item. Once a production order is created for that parent item, its production BOM will govern the calculation of material requirements as represented on the **Prod. Order Components** page.
