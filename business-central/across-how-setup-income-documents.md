# <a name="set-up-incoming-documents"></a>Set Up Incoming Documents
If you create general journal lines from incoming document records, you must specify in the **Incoming Documents Setup** window which journal template and batch to use.

If you do not want users to create invoices or general journal lines from incoming document records unless the documents are first approved, you must set up approvers in the **Incoming Document Approvers** window.

To turn PDF and image files into electronic documents that you can convert to, for example, purchase invoices inside [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you must first set up the OCR feature and enable the service.

When the Incoming Documents feature is set up, you can use different functions to review expense receipts, manage OCR tasks, and convert incoming document files, manually or automatically, to the relevant documents or journal lines. The external files can be attached at any process stage, including to posted documents and to the resulting vendor, customer, and general ledger entries. For more information, see [Processing Incoming Documents](across-process-income-documents.md).

## <a name="to-set-up-approvers-of-incoming-document-records"></a>To set up approvers of incoming document records
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Document Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Incoming Documents Setup** window, choose the **Approvers** action.

    The **Incoming Document Approvers** window shows all users that are set up in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  
3. Select one or more users that can approve an incoming document before a related document or journal line can be created.

When approvers have been set up in the **Incoming Document Approvers** window, only those users can approve an incoming document if the **Require Approval To Create** check box in the **Incoming Documents Setup** window is selected.

> [!NOTE]  
>   This approval setup is not related to approval workflows. For more information, see [Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md).
