# <a name="set-up-incoming-documents"></a>Set Up Incoming Documents
If you create general journal lines from incoming document records, you must specify on the **Incoming Documents Setup** page which journal template and batch to use.

If you do not want users to create invoices or general journal lines from incoming document records unless the documents are first approved, you must set up workflow approvers.

To turn PDF and image files into electronic documents that you can convert to, for example, purchase invoices inside [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you must first set up the OCR feature and enable the service.

When the Incoming Documents feature is set up, you can use different functions to review expense receipts, manage OCR tasks, and convert incoming document files, manually or automatically, to the relevant documents or journal lines. The external files can be attached at any process stage, including to posted documents and to the resulting vendor, customer, and general ledger entries. For more information, see [Processing Incoming Documents](across-process-income-documents.md).

## <a name="to-set-up-approvers-of-incoming-document-records"></a>To set up approvers of incoming document records
Approvers of incoming documents must be set up as approval workflow users.

Before you can create workflows that involve approval steps, you must set up the workflow users who are involved in approval processes. On the **Approval User Setup** page, you also set amount limits for specific types of requests and define substitute approvers to whom approval requests are delegated when the original approver is absent. For more information, see [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).
