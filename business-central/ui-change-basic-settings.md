<!--
Whenever the work date is not set to the current day (today), there are two indicators on pages that you open for editing:

- A reminder appears at the top of the page that tells you what the work date is set to. The reminder provides a direct link to the work date setting on the **My Settings** page so you change the date if you want. From the reminder, you can also choose to dismiss the reminder for the rest of your session. Unless you change the work date to "today", the reminder will appear the next time you sign in. 

- If you dismiss the reminder, the work date will appear in the title of the page.
