# <a name="couple-and-synchronize-records-manually"></a>Couple and Synchronise Records Manually
This topic describes how to couple one or more records in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] with records in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Coupling records lets you view [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] information from [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], and vice versa. The coupling also enables you to synchronise data between the records. You can couple existing records, or create and couple new records.

> [!Note]
> Coupling and synchronising data with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] is available only if your system administrator has created a connection between [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. A quick way to check is to open the **Customer** card and look for the **Set Up Coupling** action. If the action is available, the apps are connected.
