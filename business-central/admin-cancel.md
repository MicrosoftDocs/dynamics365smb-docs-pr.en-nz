# Unsubscribe or Remove [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

If you want to stop using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can close your account or get the licence removed from your account. The steps to take are different if you're currently using the free trial, or if you have a subscription.  

If you want to end a trial, your administrator can learn more about the different types of trials and how to end them [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/trials-subscriptions)  

If you want to end a subscription, your administrator must remove the subscription in the Microsoft 365 admin centre. For more information, see [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/trials-subscriptions?#removing-a-subscription).  

> [!TIP]
> We recommend that you export any data before you close your account.

You can read about how to export data to Excel in the [Exporting Data to Other Finance Systems](about-export-data.md#exporting-data-to-other-finance-systems). If you would rather export all data to an Azure storage container, your Microsoft 365 administrator can do that in the admin centre. For more information, see [Exporting Databases in the Admin Centre](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-database-export).  

## Removing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from your app launcher

If you want to hide [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from your app launcher, you can unpin it. No data is lost, and the step doesn't cancel your subscription.
