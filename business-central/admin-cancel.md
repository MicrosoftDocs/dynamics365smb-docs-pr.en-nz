# <a name="unsubscribe-or-remove-prodshort"></a>Unsubscribe or Remove [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]

If you want to stop using [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can close your account or get the licence removed from your account. The steps to take are different if you are currently using the free trial, or if you have a subscription.  

## <a name="closing-your-free-trial-of-prodshort"></a>Closing your free trial of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]

If you signed up for the free trial and do not want to continue with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can close your account at any time. We recommend that you export any data before you close your account. 

You must ask your Office 365 administrator to remove the trial subscription from your company's account in the [Microsoft 365 admin centre](https://admin.microsoft.com/). 

If you signed up for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] using a non-Office 365 business account, you do not have an Office 365 administrator. Instead, you must unsubscribe by contacting the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Cancelation team by sending an email message at cancelbusinesscentra@microsoft.com. You must include the name of your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] tenant in the message so that we can identify you. You can find this information in the **Help and Support** page. For more information, see [Resources for Help and Support](product-help-and-support.md).  

## <a name="unsubscribing-by-removing-d365fin-from-your-office-365-experience"></a>Unsubscribing by removing [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] from your Office 365 experience

If your company subscribes to [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] but you as a user no longer want access, you must ask your administrator or your Dynamics 365 reselling partner to remove the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] licence from your Office 365 user account. If [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is removed from your user account, and your company continues the subscription, your coworkers will still have access to your shared data in the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] company.  

If your company wants to unsubscribe from [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], the Dynamics 365 reselling partner can remove the paid subscription from the company's account. For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration) in the developer and IT-pro content.  

User accounts and licences are managed in the [Microsoft 365 admin centre](https://admin.microsoft.com/). Only administrators can remove [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] licences from user accounts or remove the subscription from your company's account.  

## <a name="removing-d365fin-from-your-app-launcher"></a>Removing [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] from your app launcher
If you want to hide [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] from your app launcher, you can quite simply unpin it. This does not remove any data, and it does not cancel your subscription.
