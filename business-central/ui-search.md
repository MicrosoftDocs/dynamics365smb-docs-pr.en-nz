# <a name="using-tell-me-to-find-features-and-information"></a>Using Tell Me to Find Features and Information  
This topic describes how Tell Me can help you quickly go to things like actions, pages, or reports, find information about how to complete a particular task, and discover additional apps and consulting services for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  
  

> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086048]

When you need help finding something, use the ![Tell me what you want to do](media/ui-search/search.png "Search for Page or Report") **Tell me what you want to do** icon to search for it. You can also use ALT+Q to start using Tell Me.

When you start typing characters, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] immediately displays matches. Results in the list change as you type more characters. If you notice that when you enter the word "product" and the results include "items," that's because Tell Me uses synonyms and alternate search terms to make it easier to find actions, pages, and reports. 

The column to the right indicates the general category of the result. For example, whether it will open a list page or is an administrative task .  

> [!NOTE]  
>   If you prefer to use your keyboard, use the Tab key and arrow keys to choose an item in the results. If you press **Enter** on your keyboard without choosing a result, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] opens the result that is listed first.

### <a name="find-an-action-on-the-current-page"></a>Find an Action on the Current Page
The **On Current Page** section lets you find and perform actions on the page you have open. For example, if the Sales Quote page is open and you type "customer," the section includes an action that opens the customer card for the customer chosen on the sales quote. 

> [!NOTE]  
>   The list includes only actions that are available in the Navigation Bar at the top of the page. Actions on FastTabs are not included.  

### <a name="find-a-page-or-a-task"></a>Find a Page or a Task
The results in the **Go to Pages and Tasks** section provide access to other pages and let you perform tasks. The pages and tasks that are listed depend on the user experience you chose for your company. The **Essential** experience gives access to fewer than the **Premium** experience does. The first time you sign in, you use the Essential experience. For more information, see [Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).

### <a name="find-a-report-or-archived-information"></a>Find a Report or Archived Information
The **Go to Reports and Analysis** section offers access to reporting tools. For example, you can open the **Balance Sheet** report from the list, or access archived documents and other information.  

### <a name="find-information-in-the-help"></a>Find Information in the Help
Under **Documentation** you will see articles from the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] documentation that describe concepts and provide step-by-step guidance for completing tasks in the application.    

> [!NOTE]  
>   Documentation for third-party extensions is not included in the results. 

### <a name="get-more-functionality-by-finding-an-app-on-microsoft-appsource"></a>Get More Functionality by Finding an App on Microsoft AppSource
Our partner community is busily developing apps that add capabilities to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. The **Get from Microsoft AppSource** section lists apps for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] that are available on Microsoft AppSource and are related to the keyword you searched for.

## <a name="searching-for-data"></a>Searching for Data
The **Tell me what you want to do** function does not search for data, such as customer names, addresses, or transactions. Instead, you can search for data in list pages by choosing the ![Search list](media/ui-search/search-list.png "Search list icon") **Search** icon in the left corner of the list header. The search applies only to the list you are viewing. For more information, see [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering Lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).

## <a name="questions"></a>Questions?
We have shown Tell Me to a range of stakeholders, noted the questions that they had in common, and turned our notes into a list frequently asked questions. If you are interested, see [Tell Me FAQ](ui-search-faq.md).
