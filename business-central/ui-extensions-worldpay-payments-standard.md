# <a name="the-worldpay-payments-standard-extension"></a>The WorldPay Payments Standard Extension
The WorldPay Payments Standard extension lets you offer customers a convenient alternative to making payments through bank transfers or credit cards. Not only that, payments made through payment services will typically land in your bank account more quickly.
If you enable the extension, and send a sales invoice or sales order by email, the document includes a link to the payment service in the email body and in the attached PDF document. A customer can choose the link, and then use the payment service to make the payment.

Enabling payment service extensions is free in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], however, you will need to contact the payment service to get an account. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payment Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).
