# Ad-hoc analysis of finance data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyse finance data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarise, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Total assets over time", "Accounts Receivable", "Accounts Payable," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyse list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages to start doing ad-hoc analysis of finance processes:

- [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20)
- [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25)
- [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29)

## Ad-hoc analysis scenarios in finance

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of finance scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on finance

When you post journals, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates entries in the **G/L Entry** table. Therefore, ad-hoc analysis on general finance is typically done on the [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20) page. For accounts receivable and payable, you can analyse [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25) and [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29), respectively.
