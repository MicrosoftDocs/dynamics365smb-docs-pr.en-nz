If Copilot functionality, such as the **Draft with Copilot** action for marketing text suggestions or the **Reconcile with Copilot** action for bank account reconciliation assist, doesn't appear on a page as expected, check the following:

- If the feature is controlled under Feature Management, make sure that it's enabled. [Learn more about feature management](admin-feature-management.md).

- Make sure that the functionality isn't hidden by personalisation. [Learn more about personalisation](ui-personalization-user.md).

When you try to use Copilot and you get an error similar to **Sorry, Copilot is not activated for \[feature\]**, there are a couple things to check:

- First, make sure that the feature is activated on the **Copilot & AI capabilities** page. [Learn more about activating Copilot and AI capabilities](enable-ai.md#activate-features). 
- Next, make sure that privacy notice statement for Azure OpenAI integration isn't set to **Disagree for everyone**. If it is, change it to **Agree for everyone**. [Learn more about privacy notices](privacy-notices-status.md).
