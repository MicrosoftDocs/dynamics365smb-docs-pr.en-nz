# Setting up fixed assets

Before you can work with fixed assets (FA), you need to define a few things:  

* How you depreciate fixed assets.  
* How you record acquisition costs, depreciations, and other values in the general ledger.  
* Optionally, how to record insurance and maintenance on fixed assets.

The sections in this article link to more information about how to set up fixed assets. After you finish the setup, you can start working with fixed assets. For more information, see [Using Fixed Assets](fa-manage.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can record fixed asset transactions in the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** or **Fixed Asset Journal** pages, depending on whether the transactions are for financial reporting or for internal management. The help articles for fixed assets only describes how to use the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page.  

When you enable a fixed asset activity in the **G/L Integration** section on the **Depreciation Book Card** page, use the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page to post transactions for the activity.
