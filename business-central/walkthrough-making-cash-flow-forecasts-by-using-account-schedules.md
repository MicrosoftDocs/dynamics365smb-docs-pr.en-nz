title: Walkthrough - Making Cash Flow Forecasts by Using Account Schedules | Microsoft Docs
description: This walkthrough describes how you can use account schedules to make cash flow forecasts. Account schedules perform calculations that cannot be done directly in the chart of cash flow accounts. In the account schedules, you can set up subtotals for cash flow receipts and disbursements. These subtotals can be included in new totals that can then be used in making cash flow forecasts.
