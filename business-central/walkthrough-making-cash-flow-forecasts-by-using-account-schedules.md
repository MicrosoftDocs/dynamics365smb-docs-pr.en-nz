# <a name="walkthrough-making-cash-flow-forecasts-using-financial-reports"></a>Walkthrough: Making Cash Flow Forecasts Using Financial Reports

This walkthrough describes how you can use the financial reports feature to make cash flow forecasts. Financial reports perform calculations that cannot be done directly in the chart of cash flow accounts. In the financial reports, you can set up subtotals for cash flow receipts and disbursements. These subtotals can be included in new totals that can then be used to make cash flow forecasts.

## <a name="setting-up-a-new-column-definition"></a>Setting up a new column definition

Before printing the cash flow forecast, Ken needs to create the column definition for the numerical information. In the columns, Ken defines the information needed to use from the lines.

- The first column has the number *C10* with the title **Amount** and contains the net change.  
- The second column has the number *C20* with the title **Balance at Date** and contains the transactions for the period.  
- The third column has the number *C30* with the title **Entire Year** and contains the net change in the balances for the entire fiscal year.  
- Finally, Ken assigns the column definition as the default option for the **Forecast** financial report.  

### <a name="set-up-a-new-column-definition"></a>Set up a new column definition

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the new **Forecast** financial report name you created. On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Edit Column Definition**.

2. Create a new column definition with the name **Cash Flow**.

3. Choose the **OK** button.

4. Enter each line exactly as shown in the following table.

    |Column No.|Column Header|Column Type|Ledger Entry Type|Amount Type|Show|  
    |----------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|----|
    |C10|Amount|Net Change|Entries|Net Amount|Always|  
    |C20|Amount Until Date|Balance at Date|Entries|Net Amount|Always|  
    |C30|Entire Fiscal Year|Entire Fiscal Year|Entries|Net Amount|Always|
