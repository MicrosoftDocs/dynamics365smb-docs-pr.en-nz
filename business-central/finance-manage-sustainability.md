# Sustainability management overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature will be available in Business Central from **2024 release wave 1**. All reference links will be enabled after they are available.

Business Central offers a sustainability management feature that helps you monitor and manage your organisation and its effect on the environment. This feature is designed to oversee and regulate an organisation's environmental footprint by tracking various greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this way, it facilitates proper insights. The feature supports the basic process of collecting emission data via sustainability journals. You can either manually enter known data or use built-in methods for calculating emissions footprints.

> [!NOTE]
> This initial release serves as foundation and is entirely independent of other Business Central features. However, future releases will aim for closer integration and might automate some manual processes.

The first version of the feature focuses on GHG emissions. The environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standard defines three emission scopes:

- **Scope 1 emissions** include emissions from stationary and mobile combustion, and from inadvertent fugitive emissions.
- **Scope 2 emissions** include indirect emissions from the generation of energy that is purchased from utility providers.
- **Scope 3 emissions** include a wide spectrum of emissions, from purchased goods and services and capital goods, to fuel and energyâ€“related activities, to upstream and downstream transportation, to generated waste, to business travel and employee commuting, and so on.

With this feature, you can:

- Set up emission factors for different sources and categories of GHG emissions.
- Record emission data in sustainability journals, either manually or by using predefined calculation methods.
- Post emission entries to the sustainability ledger, where you can view and analyse the emission data by various dimensions.
- Generate sustainability reports that show your organisation's GHG emissions performance.
