# <a name="visit-our-video-library"></a>Visit Our Video Library
Please bear with us while we rebuild our library of "how to" videos. A side effect of the recent improvements in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is that we have to reproduce our content so that it accurately reflects the product.

In the meantime, we're offering three videos that can help you quickly get up and running.

|Title|Description|
|----|----|
|Introduction|See how product features are organised, and how to get to various types of tasks and information.|
|Get started|Understand the key first steps when you are trying out [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] or have recently purchased the product. |
|Get assistance|Know where to go for answers to various types of questions.|

You can access the videos in several ways. When you start [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] for the first time, you can launch the videos from the welcome page that displays. If you're already working in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can get to the library from the **Business Manager** and **Accountant** Role Centres by choosing the **Product Videos** tile.

> [!Tip]  
> Videos in the library display in a frame that might seem a little small. To make the frame larger, choose the double-ended arrow icon in the upper-right corner. Afterward, videos will display in the larger frame until you make it small again.

You can also view our "how to" videos, plus a lot of other content, on the YouTube channel we created for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. To visit the channel now, [click here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851533).

## <a name="content-that-is-coming-soon"></a>Content that is Coming Soon
Just to mention a few examples, the videos we are updating will show how to:  

* Migrate business data from another finance app into [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]  
* Set up dimensions so you can track and analyse various documents and entities
* Connect [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] with Dynamics 365 for Sales
* Set up approval workflows  
* Use Power BI with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]  
* Set up email and send documents directly from [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]
