# <a name="customizing-business-central"></a>Customising Business Central
There are different ways to customise the application to give you and your colleagues access to the features, functionality, and data that you need most, in a manner that bests suits your daily work. Those who see the changes will depend on what you do, as described in this table.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to what administrators can customise, users can personalise their pages by adding, moving, or removing fields, freeze panes, parts, and more. For more information, see [Personalising Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

| What you can do    |  Description  |  Who sees the changes  |  More information  |

For example, Microsoft provides an extension that provides integration with PayPal Payments Standard.|All users in all companies.|[Customising Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md)|
|Change which UI elements are visible.|The **Experience** setting determines how much of the functionality is displayed in the user interface. Choose between Essential and Premium.|All users in a specific company.|[Changing Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md)|
|Manage users' personalisations.|Control and manage users' personalisation by disabling the ability to personalise pages and clearing any page personalisations.|All users in a specific company.|[Managing Personalisation as an Administrator](ui-personalization-manage.md)|

> [!NOTE]
> All feature descriptions in user documentation for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] assume the **Premium** experience, meaning the descriptions cover the full scope of UI elements. Therefore, users with the **Essential** experience may in some topics read about functionality and UI elements that are not visible in their user interface.
