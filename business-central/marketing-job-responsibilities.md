# <a name="set-up-job-responsibilities-for-contact-persons"></a>Set Up Job Responsibilities for Contact Persons
You can add information about the job responsibilities of contact persons to indicate what the contact person is responsible for within their company, for example, IT, management, or production. You can use this information when entering information about your contacts.

Using job responsibilities on contacts is a two-step process. First, you define the job responsibility code. You only have to perform this step one time for each job responsibility. Once you have a job responsibility code, you can start to assign the code to contact persons.

## <a name="to-define-a-job-responsibility-code"></a>To define a job responsibility code
The job responsibility code defines the type or category of the job, such a MARKETING or PURCHASE. You can have several job responsibility codes. To define the job responsibility, you use the **Job Responsibilities** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Responsibilities**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action, and fill in a code and description. The code can be a maximum of 11 characters, and can be any combination of numbers and letters.

## <a name="to-assign-job-responsibilities-to-a-contact-person"></a>To assign job responsibilities to a contact person
You cannot assign job responsibilities to contact companies.

1. Open the contact person.
2. Choose the **Person** action, and then choose the **Job Responsibilities** action. The **Contact Job Responsibilities** page opens.
3. In the **Job Responsibility Code** field, select the job responsibility that you want to assign.

Repeat these steps to assign as many job responsibilities as you want. You can also assign job responsibilities from the contact list by following the same procedure.

The number of job responsibilities you have assigned to the contact is displayed in the **No. of Job Responsibilities** field in the **Segmentation** section on the **Contact** page.

After you have assigned job responsibilities to your contacts, you can use this information to select contacts for your segments. For more information, see [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).
