# <a name="setting-up-contacts"></a>Setting Up Contacts
When creating contacts, you can enter specific information, such as the industry that the contact companies belong to and your business relationship with the contacts.

Before you create contacts and record details about your business relationships, you must set up the different codes that you will use to assign this information to your contact companies and people. Codes can be set up for mailing groups, industry groups, business relationships, Web sources, organisational levels and job responsibilities.

By having this information set up, creating contacts is much more organised and being able to find all contacts based on a certain group will be more efficient. Every group at your company will be able to find the is information making communication with the contacts more successful.

In connection with setting up your contacts, you must set up the business relationship that you have with your contacts, for example, prospect, bank, consultant, and service supplier. For more information, see [Setting Up Business Relations on Contacts Companies](marketing-business-relations.md).

## <a name="setting-up-industry-groups-for-contact-companies"></a>Setting Up Industry Groups for Contact Companies
You use industry groups to indicate the type of industry to which your contacts belong, for example, the retail industry or the automobile industry.

Using industry groups on contacts is a two-step process. First, you define the industry group code. You only have to perform this step one time for each industry group. Once you have an industry group code, you can start to assign the code to contact companies.

> [!NOTE]  
>   If you plan to synchronise your contacts with vendors, customers, or bank accounts in other parts of the application, you may want to set up a business relation for them.

### <a name="to-define-an-industry-group-code"></a>To define an industry group code
The industry group code defines the type or category of the group, such as ADVERT for advertising, or PRESS, for TV and radio. You can have several industry group codes. To define the industry groups, you use the **Industry Groups** page.
