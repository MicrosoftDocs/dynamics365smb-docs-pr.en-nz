title: How to Trace Item-Tracked Items | Microsoft Docs
description: You can see where an item-tracked item was used, including how and when it was received or produced, transferred, sold, consumed, or returned. You can also find all current instances of a specific serial or lot number in the database. You do this by using the Item Tracing and the Navigate features.
