# <a name="keyboard-shortcuts"></a>Keyboard Shortcuts
This article provides an overview of some of the shortcut key combinations that you can use when you are working with [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)].

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
The keyboard shortcuts aide accessibility and can make it easier and more efficient to navigate to different areas and elements on a page.

The keyboard shortcuts are supported by most web browsers; however the behaviour may vary slightly.

The keyboard shortcuts described here refer to the U.S. keyboard layout. The layout of the keys on other keyboards may not correspond exactly to the keys on a U.S. keyboard.

##  <a name="Keyboard"></a> General Keyboard Shortcuts
The following table describes keyboard shortcuts for navigating and accessing different elements of a page, such as actions, drop-down lists, lookups, and more. For details about keyboard shortcuts for navigating records once you get inside a list, see the next section. 

|Press these keys|To do this|  
|----------------|-----------|  
|Tab|Move focus to the next control or element on a page, such as actions, buttons, fields, or list headings.| 
|Shift+Tab|Move focus to the previous control or element on a page, such as buttons, fields, or list headings.|   
|Enter|Enable or access the element or control that is in focus.|   
|Alt+Down Arrow|Open a drop-down list or look up a value for a field.|    
|Alt+Right Arrow|See the transactions that resulted in a calculated value in a field.|  


## <a name="keyboard-shortcuts-in-lists"></a>Keyboard Shortcuts in Lists

The following table describes the keyboard shortcuts that you can use in a list page. The shortcut action is slightly different depending on whether the page is shown in the list view or tile view.

Most of the shortcuts are the same no matter whether the operating system is Windows or macOS; however, there are some shortcuts that are different for macOS than Windows. These are indicated in parantheses in the table as well.

>[!Note]
>In the table that follows, the term *actionable field* refers to a field on which you can do something, like change a value or link to another page. In general, the shortcuts will skip over fields that display information that you cannot change from the list (in other words, fields that are read-only).
