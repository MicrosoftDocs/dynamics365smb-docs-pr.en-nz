# <a name="keyboard-shortcuts"></a>Keyboard Shortcuts
This article provides an overview of some of the shortcut key combinations that you can use when you are working with [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)].

[Print-friendly keyboard shortcut reference](keyboard-shortcuts-cheatsheet.md)

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
The keyboard shortcuts aide accessibility and can make it easier and more efficient to navigate to different areas and elements on a page.

The keyboard shortcuts are supported by most web browsers; however, the behaviour may vary slightly.

The keyboard shortcuts described here refer to the U.S. keyboard layout. The layout of the keys on other keyboards may not correspond exactly to the keys on a U.S. keyboard.

Most of the shortcuts are the same no matter whether the operating system is Pages or macOS; however, there are some shortcuts that differ for macOS. These are indicated in parentheses in the tables in the sections that follow.

##  <a name="Keyboard"></a> General Keyboard Shortcuts
The following table describes keyboard shortcuts for navigating and accessing different elements of a page, such as actions, drop-down lists, lookups, and more. For details about keyboard shortcuts for navigating records once you get inside a list, see the next section.

|Press these keys<br />(in macOS)|To do this|  
|----------------|-----------|  
|Alt+Q<br />(Ctrl+Alt+Q)|Open **Tell me what you want to do** box that can help you find a page, a report, an action on the current page, or an article in the documentation.|
|Alt+Up Arrow|Show tooltip for a field or a column header of a table. If the field has validation errors, press "Alt+Up Arrow" to show the validation error. Press "Esc" or "Alt+Up Arrow" to close the tooltip.|

|Alt+Down Arrow|Open a drop-down list or look up a value for a field.|    
|Alt+Right Arrow|See the transactions that resulted in a calculated value in a field.|

## <a name="keyboard-shortcuts-in-lists"></a>Keyboard Shortcuts in Lists

The following table describes the keyboard shortcuts that you can use in a list page. The shortcut action is slightly different depending on whether the page is shown in the list view or tile view.
<!-- 
> [!Note]
> In the table that follows, the term *actionable field* refers to a field on which you can do something, like change a value or link to another page. In general, the shortcuts will skip over fields that display information that you cannot change from the list (in other words, fields that are read-only).
