# <a name="upgrading-an-integration-with-dynamics-365-sales"></a>Upgrading an Integration with Dynamics 365 Sales
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], which makes it easy to connect and synchronise data with other Dynamics 365 applications, such as [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], or even apps that you build yourself. If you are integrating for the first time, we recommend that you do so through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Integration with Dataverse](admin-common-data-service.md).

If you have already integrated [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can continue to synchronise data using your setup. However, if you upgrade [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or turn off your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration, to turn it on again you must connect through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. 

> [!NOTE]
> Reconnecting through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] will apply default synchronisation settings, and will overwrite any configurations you have. For example, the default table mappings will be applied.

## <a name="to-upgrade-your-connection-to-use-dataverse"></a>To upgrade your connection to use Dataverse
1. Open the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, and then turn off the **Enabled** toggle to disconnect from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
2. Open the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, and choose the **Enabled** toggle to turn on the connection to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].
  
   After you enable the connection, the Business Central Integration Solution is deployed to Dataverse.
3. Choose **Redeploy Integration Solution** to reinstall the Business Central Integration Solution.
4. On the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, turn on the **Enabled** toggle to reconnect to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
  
   This enables integration with tables that are specific to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as sales orders, quotes, and invoices.
5. On the **Sales Connection Setup** page, choose **Use Default Synchronisation Setup** to initialise the integration table mappings for [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
