# <a name="specify-printer-selection-for-reports"></a>Specify Printer Selection for Reports
This page is empty because you cannot yet set up specific printers for specific reports. We are working on solving this.

In the meantime, when you want to print a report, you have to download the report as a PDF document first by choosing the **Send to** button. Then you select the type of file to download the report as, and here you should pick **PDF Document**. Now, you can either open the PDF document right-away and print it, or save it and print it later.

<!--

You can set up reports so that they must be printed on a specific printer. The following are some uses of printer selection:

- You can print reports on special company letterhead.
- You can print reports on different paper sizes.
- You can print reports on the default printer of a specified employee.

You use the **Printer Selections** window to set different values to obtain different output. If you set a specific printer selection, then it takes precedence over a more general printer selection. For example, you can set a printer selection that has values in the **User ID**, **Report ID**, and **Printer Name** fields. This printer selection takes precedence over a printer selection that has blank entries in the **User ID** or **Report ID** fields.

The following table describes the combination of values to specify when you set up printer selections for a report.

|To                                                 |Set the following values                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Print a report to a specific printer for all users |Specify values in the **Report ID** and **Printer Name** fields and leave the **User ID** field blank.|
|Print all reports to a specific printer for a specific user|Specify values in the **User ID** and **Printer Name** fields and leave the **Report ID** field blank.|
|Set the default printer for all reports|Specify a value in the **Printer Name** field and leave the **User ID** and **Report ID** fields blank.|
|Print a specific report to the userâ€™s default printer|Specify a value in the **Report ID** field and leave the **Printer Name** and **User ID** fields blank.|
|Print a specific report to a specific printer for a specific user|Specify values in all three fields.|
