[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] can help you work smarter by notifying you about certain events or changes in status, such as when you are about to invoice a customer who has an overdue balance, or the available inventory is lower than the quantity you are about to sell, for example. These notifications are shown as discreet tips in the context of the task you are doing, and you can choose to ignore the notification or to see details about the issue.  

If you choose to see details for a notification, you can take action to resolve the issue, such as contacting the customer, buying more inventory, and so on. It's your choice what to do, and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] gives you advice and recommendations.  

Notifications can help untrained users complete unfamiliar tasks, and do not reduce productivity for the more trained user.  

## <a name="to-turn-notifications-on-or-off-and-control-when-they-are-sent"></a>To turn notifications on or off, and control when they are sent

When you first start with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] all notifications are turned on, but you can turn them on or off, for example, if you aren't interested in a certain event or status.  

Additionally, some notifications let you specify the conditions under which they are sent. For example, if you want to be notified when inventory is running low, but only for items you buy from a certain vendor.  

Turning notifications on or off, and specifying conditions, applies only to you.  

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role centre"), and then choose the **My Settings** action.  
2. On the **My Settings** page, in the **Notifications** field, choose the *Change when I receive notifications.* link.  
3. In the page that appears, turn on or turn off a notification by selecting or clearing the **Enabled** check box.  
4. To specify conditions that trigger a notification, choose the **View filter details** link, and then fill in the fields.
