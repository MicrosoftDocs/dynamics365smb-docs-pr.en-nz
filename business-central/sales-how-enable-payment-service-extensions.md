# <a name="enable-customer-payments-through-payment-services"></a>Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services

As an alternative to collecting payments through bank transfer or credit cards, your customers can pay you through their account with payment services, such as PayPal or WorldPay.  

After you enable a payment service in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a link to the service is available on sales documents that you send by email to your customers. Customers can use the link to go to the payment service and pay the bill, directly from the sales document. If you don't want to include the link, for example, if a customer will pay with cash, you can remove the payment service from the invoice before posting.  

The PayPal Payments Standard and WorldPay Payments Standard extensions are installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and are ready for you to enable.  

> [!CAUTION]
> The WorldPay Payments Standard extension will be deprecated. The code is market as obsolete starting in 2023 release wave 2. The app will be active for the next three major releases and then it will be removed.
