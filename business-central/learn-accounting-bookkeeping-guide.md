# <a name="accounting-and-bookkeeping"></a>Accounting and bookkeeping

Accounting is a critical function in any enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, and also in most businesses. Accounting represents the process of recording and cataloging a company's financial transactions, and then retrieving, measuring, summarising, and presenting the results by using different reports that are often required by local legislation. The primary goal of this process is to help the company's management understand the financials of the business and measure the results of the company's economic activities.

Bookkeeping is one part of the accounting process and involves regularly recording all financial transactions in a company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is an ERP system that includes integrated tools to make bookkeeping easier in the system. Many actions can be done automatically.

This article provides an outline of bookkeeping processes, including the rules, procedures, and other guidelines in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The content of this article is intended to help accountants and bookkeepers complete their daily work in this ERP system. For additional help, a context-based assistant is incorporated into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This assistant contains links to information that's related to the current page and instructions for working with the relevant process. To access it, select the [**Help**](product-help-and-support.md) button in the upper-right corner to open the **Help** pane. Then use the links in the **About this task or page** and **Related resources from Microsoft Learn** sections.
