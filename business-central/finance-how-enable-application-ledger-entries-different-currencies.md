# <a name="enable-application-of-ledger-entries-in-different-currencies"></a>Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies
If you purchase from a vendor in one currency and submit payment in another currency, you can apply the payment to the purchase.

Likewise, if you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency, you can apply the payment to the sales invoice.

The following procedure describes how to set this up for vendor ledger entries on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page. The setup is similar for customer ledger entries on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.
