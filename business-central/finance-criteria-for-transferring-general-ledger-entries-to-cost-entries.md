It is important to understand the criteria for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries. During the transfer, the **Transfer GL Entries to CA** batch job uses the following criteria to determine if and how the general ledger entries are transferred.  

General ledger entries are transferred if:  

-   The entries have dimension values corresponding to either a cost centre or a cost object.  
-   The entries have dimension values that correspond to a cost centre and a cost object. For these entries, the cost centre takes precedence. This helps avoid a situation where a cost type appears in both a cost object and a cost centre and is therefore counted twice in the statistics.  
-   The document number in the entries is empty, so it will appear with a document number of 0000 in the cost entries.  
-   The entries are transferred to a cost type that allows for combined entries and these entries are transferred as a combined entry either monthly or daily.  

General ledger entries are not transferred if:  

-   The entries have dimension values that do not correspond to a cost centre or a cost object.  
-   The entries have an amount of zero.  
-   The entries have a general ledger account that has been deleted.  
-   The entries have a general ledger account that is not of the type **Income Statement**.  
-   The entries have a general ledger account that is not assigned a cost type.  
-   The entries have a posting date before the **Starting Date for G/L Transfer**.  
-   The entries have been posted with a closing date. These are typically entries that set back the balance of the income statement at the end of the year.
