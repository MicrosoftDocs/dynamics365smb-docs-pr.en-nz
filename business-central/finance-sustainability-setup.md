# <a name="sustainability-setup"></a>Sustainability setup

To have the Sustainability module working properly, you first need to set up some basic controls and instruction related to whole functionality.  

To set up a sustainability module, follow the next steps:  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, configure the required fields related to this module:   

|  Field  |  Description  |  
|--------|--------------| 
| **Emission Unit of Measure Code** | Specifies the unit of measure code that is used to register emission. |
| **Emission Decimal Places** | Specifies the number of decimal places that are shown for emission amounts. The default setting, 2:5, specifies that all amounts are shown with a minimum of 2 decimal places and a maximum of 5 decimal places. You can also enter a fixed number, such as 2, which also means that amounts are shown with two decimals. |
| **Country/Region Mandatory** | Specifies if country/region is mandatory. You can use this field in journals without configuring this, but, you can select it, if you want to enforce users to populate the field before posting. |
| **Responsibility Centre Mandatory** | Specifies if responsibility centre is mandatory, as the responsibility centre can be used as a facility for measuring facilty-based emissions. You can use this field in journals without configuring this, but, you can select it, if you want to enforce users to populate the field before posting. |
| **Block Calculation Foundation Change If Ledger Entries Exist** | Specifies if the change of calculation foundation at the Account Category is blocked at the time of sustainability entry, which means this formula has been applied already. |
| **Enable Background Error Check** | Specifies if the background error check of sustainability journal lines is enabled. |

3.  On the **Calculations** FastTab, configure required fields related to the formulas used for calculating emissions:  

|  Field  |  Description  |  
|--------|--------------| 
| **Fuel/Electricity Decimal Places** | Specifies the number of decimal places that are shown for fuel/electricity amounts. The default setting, 2:5, specifies that all amounts are shown with a minimum of 2 decimal places and a maximum of 5 decimal places. You can also enter a fixed number, such as 2, which also means that amounts are shown with two decimals. |
| **Distance Decimal Places** | Specifies the number of decimal places that are shown for distance measurements. The default setting, 2:5, specifies that all amounts are shown with a minimum of 2 decimal places and a maximum of 5 decimal places. You can also enter a fixed number, such as 2, which also means that amounts are shown with two decimals. |
| **Custom Amount Decimal Places** | Specifies the number of decimal places that are shown for custom amounts. The default setting, 2:5, specifies that all amounts are shown with a minimum of 2 decimal places and a maximum of 5 decimal places. You can also enter a fixed number, such as 2, which also means that amounts are shown with two decimals. |

4.  Finish the set up on the **Reporting** FastTab, related to reporting to authorities:   

|  Field  |  Description  |  
|--------|--------------| 
| **Emission Reporting Unit of Measure Code** | Specifies the unit of measure code that is used to report emission, as you can use different unit of measure while reporting to authorities. This field isn't applicable to the standard reports. |
| **Reporting UOM Factor** | Specifies the unit of measure factor that is used to register emission if you use different unit of measure while reporting to authorities. |
| **Emission Rounding Precision** | Specifies the size of the interval to be used when rounding emission amounts while reporting to authorities. |
| **Emission Rounding Type** | Specifies how the program rounds an emission amount while reporting to authorities, using options: Nearest, Up, or Down. |

>[!NOTE]
> In version 24.0, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not support reporting to any authority. So, field related to configuration on the **Reporting** FastTab, will be used for future reporting capabilities, but it can also be used by partners in localised versions.
