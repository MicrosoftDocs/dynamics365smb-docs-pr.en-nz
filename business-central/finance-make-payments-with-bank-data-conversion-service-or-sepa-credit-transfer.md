In the **Payment Journal** window, you can process payments to your vendors by exporting a file together with the payment information from the journal lines. You can then upload the file to your electronic bank where the related money transfers are processed. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] supports the SEPA Credit Transfer format, but in your country/region, other formats for electronic payments may be available.   

 To enable SEPA credit transfers, you must first set up a bank account, a vendor, and the general journal batch that the payment journal is based on. You then prepare payments to vendors by automatically filling the **Payment Journal** window with due payments with specified posting dates.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When you have verified that the payments are successfully processed by the bank, you can proceed to post the payment journal lines.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
