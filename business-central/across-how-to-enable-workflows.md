# <a name="enable-approval-workflows"></a>Enable Approval Workflows

When you've created an approval workflow and you're sure it's good to go, you must enable it.  

On the **Workflow** page, create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).
