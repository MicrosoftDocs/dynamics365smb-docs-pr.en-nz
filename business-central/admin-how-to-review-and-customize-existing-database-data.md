# <a name="review-and-customize-existing-database-data"></a>Review and Customise Existing Database Data
As you create a configuration package for a solution, you can view and customise the available database data to suit your customer needs. The database table has to have an associated page.  

### <a name="to-customize-data-in-the-database"></a>To customise data in the database  

1.  In the configuration worksheet, identify the tables whose data that you want to view or customise.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Make sure that each table has a page ID assigned to it. For standard [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] tables, this value is automatically filled in. For custom tables, you have to provide the ID.  

2.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Show** group, choose **Database Data**.  

     The [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] page for the page opens.  

3.  Review the available information. Modify it as necessary by deleting records that are not relevant or by adding new ones.
