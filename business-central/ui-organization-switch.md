[!INCLUDE [company_environment](includes/company_environment.md)] For more information, see [Creating New Companies in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]](about-new-company.md).  

> [!TIP]
> If you often switch between companies, it can be easy to lose track of where you are. To help you keeping track, you can add a badge that will display the company name, so you can quickly verify that you are in the right place. For more information, see [To display a company badge for quick access to company information](ui-change-basic-settings.md#to-display-a-company-badge-for-quick-access-to-company-information).

When you are signed in to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], the environments that you can access are available on the Dynamics 365 Home page. You can open the page by choosing the **App Launcher** icon ![App Launcher](media/app-launcher-icon.png "The App Launcher provides access to more features") and choosing **Dynamics 365** . To go to your default company in that environment, choose the tile. There will be one tile for each type of environment. If you have more than one environment of a certain type, when you choose the tile you can choose the environment to access.

The following image shows tiles for accessing production and sandbox environments on the Dynamics 365 Home page.

When you are signed in to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can quickly switch to another company. After you make the switch, the company you choose becomes your default company and will display the next time you sign in.

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role centre"), and then choose the **My Settings** action.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also use the Alt+T keyboard shortcut to quickly open the My Settings page.

2. On the **My Settings** page, in the **Company** field, select the company.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.

> [!TIP]
> A good way to go directly to your default company when you sign in, and avoid having to specify an environment, is to add the the URL to your list of favourites after you sign in.
