# <a name="set-up-a-connection-to-dynamics-365-sales"></a>Set Up a Connection to Dynamics 365 Sales
This topic describes how to set up a connection between [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
<br><br>  

> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085501]

## <a name="before-you-start"></a>Before You Start
Before you create the connection, there are a few pieces of information to have ready:  

* A URL for your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] app. A fast way to get the URL is to open [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], copy the URL, and then paste it in the **Dynamics 365 Sales URL** field in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] will correct the formatting for you.  
* A user name and password of a user account that is used only for the integration.  
* The user name and password of the account that has administrator permissions.  

> [!Note]
> These steps describe the procedure for the online version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].

## <a name="set-up-test-and-enable-a-connection-to-includecrm_mdincludescrm_mdmd"></a>Set Up, Test, and Enable a Connection to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]  
For all authentication types other than Office 365 authentication, you set up your connection to Dynamics 365 Sales on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup** page. For Office 365 authentication, you can also use the **Set Up Dynamics 365 Sales Connection** assisted setup guide, which will help you provide the required information.

### <a name="to-use-an-assisted-setup-guide"></a>To use an assisted setup guide
The **Set Up Dynamics 365 Sales Connection** assisted setup guide can help you set up the connection and specify whether to enable advanced features, such as coupling between records.

1. Choose **Setup and Extensions**, and then choose **Assisted Setup**.
2. Choose **Set Up Dynamics 365 Sales Connection** to start the assisted setup guide.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Optionally, there are advanced settings that can enhance security and enable [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] additional capabilities, such as sales order processing and viewing inventory levels. The following table describes the advanced settings.  

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----|
|**Import Dynamics 365 Sales Solution**|Enable this to install and configure the integration solution in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For more information, see [About the Business Central Integration Solution](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md#about-the-business-central-integration-solution).|
|**Publish Item Availability Web Service**|Enable people who are using [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] to view the availability of items (products) in inventory in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. This requires that the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] user account with a web services access key. Assigning the key is a two-step process. On the user account in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] you must choose the **Change Web Service Key** action. In the Set Up Dynamics 365 Sales Connection assisted setup guide, you must specify the Dynamics 365 Business Central OData web service URL, and provide [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] user credentials for accessing the service. For more information, see [OData Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/odata-web-services).|
|**Dynamics 365 Business Central OData Web Service URL**|If you enable the Item Availability Web Service, the URL for the OData Web service is provided for you.|
|**Dynamics 365 Business Central OData Web Service Username**|The name of the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] user account that the [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] uses to retrieve information about item availability in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] through OData Web Service.|
|**Dynamics 365 Business Central OData Web Service Accesskey**|The access key for the user account that the [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] uses to get information about item availability from [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] through OData Web Service. The key is assigned to the user chosen in the **Dynamics 365 Business Central OData Web Service Username** field. To get the key, choose the **Look up value** button next to the user name, choose the user, choose **Manage**, and then **Edit**. On the user card, choose **Actions**, **Authentication**, and then choose **Change Web Service Key**.|
|**Enable Sales Order Integration**|When people create sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and fullfill orders in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], this integrates the process in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For more information, see [Enable sales order processing integration](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/sales-enterprise/developer/enable-sales-order-processing-integration). This requires that you provide credentials for an administrator user account in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For more information, see [Handling Sales Order Data](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md#handling-sales-order-data).|
|**Enable Dynamics 365 for Sales Connection**|Enable the connection to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].|
|**Dynamics 365 SDK Version**|This is relevant only if you are integrating with an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. This is the Dynamics 365 software development kit (also referred to as Xrm) you use to connect [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. The version must be compatible with the SDK version that is used by [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], and equal to or newer than the version used by [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].|

> [!Note]
> **Set Up Dynamics 365 Sales Connection** assisted setup guide automatically assigns **Integration Administrator** and **Integration User** security roles to the user account used for integration.

<!--## Install the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md) Integration Solution
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] includes a solution that enables users to access coupled records, such as customers and items, from records in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as accounts and products. The solution adds a link to the pages in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] to open the coupled [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] record. The solution also displays information from [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]on certain entities in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as accounts. Installing this solution is optional. <!--"Solution" sounds old school. Is it an app, or an add-in, or an extension?


1.  From [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] installation media \(DVD\), copy the DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution.zip file to your computer.  

     The DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution.zip file is located in the **CrmCustomization** folder. This file is the solution package.   

2.  In [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], import the DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution.zip as a solution.  

     This step adds the **[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md) Connection** entity and **[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md) Account Statistics** entity in the system and additional items such as [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] integration security roles.  

     For more information about how to manage solutions in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616519](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616519).  

3.  Optional: Set up the **[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md) Connection** entity to display in the **Settings** area of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  

     This enables [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] users who are assigned the **[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md) Admin** role to modify the entity in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For more information about how to modify entities in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], see [View or edit entity information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616521).  

4.  Assign the **[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md) Integration Administrator** role to the user account for the connection to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  

5.  Assign the **Business Central Integration User** role to all users who will use the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] integration solution.  

If you install the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] integration solution after you have set up the connection to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you must modify the connection setup to point to the URL.-->
