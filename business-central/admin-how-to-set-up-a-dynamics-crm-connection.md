<!--## Install the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md) Integration Solution
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] includes a solution that enables users to access coupled records, such as customers and items, from records in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as accounts and products. The solution adds a link to the pages in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] to open the coupled [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] record. The solution also displays information from [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]on certain entities in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as accounts. Installing this solution is optional. <!--"Solution" sounds old school. Is it an app, or an add-in, or an extension?


1.  From [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] installation media \(DVD\), copy the DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution.zip file to your computer.  

     The DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution.zip file is located in the **CrmCustomization** folder. This file is the solution package.   

2.  In [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], import the DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution.zip as a solution.  

     This step adds the **[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md) Connection** entity and **[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md) Account Statistics** entity in the system and additional items such as [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] integration security roles.  

     For more information about how to manage solutions in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616519](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616519).  

3.  Optional: Set up the **[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md) Connection** entity to display in the **Settings** area of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  

     This enables [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] users who are assigned the **[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md) Admin** role to modify the entity in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For more information about how to modify entities in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], see [View or edit entity information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616521).  

4.  Assign the **[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md) Integration Administrator** role to the user account for the connection to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  

5.  Assign the **Business Central Integration User** role to all users who will use the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] integration solution.  

If you install the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] integration solution after you have set up the connection to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you must modify the connection setup to point to the URL.-->
