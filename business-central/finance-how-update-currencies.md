# <a name="update-currency-exchange-rates"></a>Update Currency Exchange Rates
As companies operate in increasingly more countries/regions, it becomes more important that they be able to trade and report financials in more than one currency. You must set up a code for each currency you use if you buy or sell in currencies other than your local currency, have receivables or payables in other currencies, or record G/L transactions in different currencies.

Your general ledger is set up to use your local currency (LCY), but you can set it up to also use another currency with a current exchange rate assigned. By designating a second currency as a so-called additional reporting currency, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] will automatically record amounts in both LCY and this additional reporting currency on each G/L entry and other entries, such as VAT entries. For more information, see [Set Up an Additional Reporting Currency](finance-how-setup-additional-currencies.md).

## <a name="adjusting-exchange-rates"></a>Adjusting Exchange Rates
Because exchange rates fluctuate constantly, additional currency equivalents in your system must be adjusted periodically. If these adjustments are not done, amounts that have been converted from foreign (or additional) currencies and posted to the general ledger in LCY may be misleading. In addition, daily entries posted before a daily exchange rate is entered into application must be updated after the daily exchange rate information is entered.

The **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job is used to manually adjust the exchange rates of posted customer, vendor and bank account entries. It can also update additional reporting currency amounts on G/L entries. You can also have the exchange rates adjusted automatically by using a service. For more information, see [To set up a currency exchange rate service](finance-how-update-currencies.md#to-set-up-a-currency-exchange-rate-service).

### <a name="effect-on-customers-and-vendors"></a>Effect on Customers and Vendors
For customer and vendor accounts, the batch job adjusts the currency by using the exchange rate that is valid on the posting date that is specified in the batch job. The batch job calculates the differences for the individual currency balances and posts the amounts to the general ledger account that is specified in the **Unrealised Gains Acc.** field or the **Unrealised Losses Acc.** field on the **Currencies** page. Balancing entries are automatically posted to the receivables/payables account in the general ledger.

The batch job processes all open customer ledger entries and vendor ledger entries. If there is an exchange rate difference for an entry, the batch job creates a new detailed customer or vendor ledger entry which reflects the adjusted amount on the customer or vendor ledger entry.

#### <a name="dimensions-on-customer-and-vendor-ledger-entries"></a>Dimensions on Customer and Vendor Ledger Entries
The adjustment entries are assigned the dimensions from the customer/vendor ledger entries, and the adjustments are posted per combination of dimension values.

### <a name="effect-on-bank-accounts"></a>Effect on Bank Accounts
For bank accounts, the batch job adjusts the currency by using the exchange rate that is valid on the posting date specified in the batch job. The batch job calculates the differences for each bank account that has a currency code and posts the amounts to the general ledger account that is specified in the **Realised Gains Acc.** field or the **Realised Losses Acc.** field on the **Currencies** page. Balancing entries are automatically posted to the general ledger bank accounts that are specified in the bank account posting groups. The batch job calculates one entry per currency per posting group.

#### <a name="dimensions-on-bank-account-entries"></a>Dimensions on Bank Account Entries
The adjustment entries for the bank account's general ledger account and for the gain/loss account are assigned the bank account's default dimensions.

### <a name="effect-on-gl-accounts"></a>Effect on G/L Accounts
If you post in an additional reporting currency, you can have the batch job create new general ledger entries for currency adjustments between LCY and the additional reporting currency. The batch job calculates the differences for each general ledger entry and adjusts the general ledger entry depending on the contents of the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** field for each general ledger account.

##### <a name="dimensions-on-gl-account-entries"></a>Dimensions on G/L Account Entries
The adjustment entries are assigned the default dimensions from the accounts they are posted to.

> [!Important]
> Before you can use the batch job, you must enter the adjustment exchange rates that are used to adjust the foreign currency balances. You do so on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.<br><br>
