# <a name="update-currency-exchange-rates"></a>Update Currency Exchange Rates
As companies operate in increasingly more countries/regions, it becomes more important that they be able to trade and report financials in more than one currency. You must set up a code for each currency you use if you buy or sell in currencies other than your local currency, have receivables or payables in other currencies, or record G/L transactions in different currencies.

Your general ledger is set up to use your local currency (LCY), but you can set it up to also use another currency with a current exchange rate assigned. By designating a second currency as a so-called additional reporting currency, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] will automatically record amounts in both LCY and this additional reporting currency on each G/L entry and other entries, such as VAT entries. For more information, see [Set Up an Additional Reporting Currency](finance-how-setup-additional-currencies.md).

## <a name="adjusting-exchange-rates"></a>Adjusting Exchange Rates
Because exchange rates fluctuate constantly, additional currency equivalents in your system must be adjusted periodically. If these adjustments are not done, amounts that have been converted from foreign (or additional) currencies and posted to the general ledger in LCY may be misleading. In addition, daily entries posted before a daily exchange rate is entered into the program must be updated after the daily exchange rate information is entered. The Adjust Exchange Rates batch job is used to adjust the exchange rates of posted customer, vendor and bank account entries. It can also update additional reporting currency amounts on G/L entries.
