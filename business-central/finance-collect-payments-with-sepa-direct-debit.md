# <a name="collect-payments-with-sepa-direct-debit"></a>Collect Payments with SEPA Direct Debit
With your customer’s consent, you can collect payments directly from the customer’s bank account according to the SEPA format.  

 First, set up the export format of the bank file that instructs your bank to perform a direct debit. Then, set up the customer’s payment method. Last, set up the direct-debit mandate that reflects your agreement with the customer to collect their payments in a certain agreement period.  

 To instruct the bank to transfer the payment amount from the customer’s bank account to your company’s account, you create a direct-debit collection entry, which holds information about bank accounts, the affected sales invoices, and the direct-debit mandate. You then export an XML file that is based on the collection entry, which you send to your bank for processing. Any payments that could not be processed will be communicated to you by your bank, and you must then manually reject the direct debit-collection entries in question.  

 You can set up standard customer sales codes with the direct-debit payment method and mandate information. You can then use the **Create Standard Cust. Invoices** batch job to generate multiple sales invoices with the direct-debit information prefilled. This is can be done manually or automatically, according to the payment due date.  

 When payments are successfully processed, as communicated by your bank, you can post the payment receipts either directly from the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page or by moving the payment lines to the journal where you post payment receipts, such as the **Cash Receipt Journal** page. Alternatively, depending on your cash management process, you can wait and just apply the payments as a part of bank reconciliation.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  To collect payments using SEPA Direct Debit, the currency on the sales invoice must be EURO.  

## <a name="setting-up-sepa-direct-debit"></a>Setting Up SEPA Direct Debit
From the **Direct Debit Collections** page, you can export instructions to your electronic bank to perform a direct debit collection from the customer’s bank account to your bank account. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] supports the SEPA direct debit format, but in your country/region, other formats for electronic payments may be available.  

To enable export of a bank file formats that are not supported out of the box in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] , you can set up a data exchange definition by using the data exchange framework. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

## <a name="creating-sepa-direct-debit-collection-entries-and-export-to-a-bank-file"></a>Creating SEPA Direct Debit Collection Entries and Export to a Bank File

 4. Choose the **OK** button.  

      A direct-debit collection is added to the **Direct Debit Collections** page, and one or more direct-debit collection entries are created.

 If the exported file cannot be processed, for example because the customer is insolvent, you can reject the direct-debit collection entry.
