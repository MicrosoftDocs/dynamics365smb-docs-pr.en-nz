Depending on the report, the request page might include the **Use default values from** field. This field lets you select a predefined set of can include the **Saved Settings** section that contains one or more entries in the **Use default value from** box. A saved setting is basically a predefined group of options and filters that you can apply to the report before previewing or sending the report to a file. The saved settings entry called **Last used options and filters** is always available. This entry sets the report to use options and filters that were used the last time you used the report.

Using saved settings is a fast and reliable way to consistently generate reports that contain the correct data. After you set the **Use default value from** box to a saved settings entry, you can change any of the options and filters before previewing or saving the report. The changes that you make will not be saved to the saved settings entry you selected, but they will be saved to the **Last used options and filters** entry.

>[!NOTE]
>If you are an administrator, you can create and manage the saved settings for reports for all users. For more information, see [Manage Saved Settings for Reports and Batch Jobs](reports-saving-reusing-settings.md).

### Printer selection

The report prints to the printer shown in the **Selected printer** field on the report request page. You can't change the printer from this page.

The selected printer is either set on the **Printer Selections** page or it's the default printer set up on the **Printer Management** page. If you want to use another printer, see  [Set Up Printers](ui-specify-printer-selection-reports.md).

If no printer is specified on the **Printer Selections** page or set as default on the **Printer Management** page, the browser printing feature is used. In this case, **Browser** appears in the **Selected printer** field on the report request page.

### Browser printing

Because [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] is a cloud service, it can't reach local printers connected to your computer. However, it can connect to cloud-enabled printers. In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], a cloud printer named **Email Printer** is installed as an extension and is ready to use after initial setup.

If a cloud printer is not installed and set up, or if an installed printer fails, then printing will default to the printing options for the browser.

> [!NOTE]
> The browser printing options work independently of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]. So any printer settings that might have been set up from printers in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] aren't carried over to the browser print options.

<!-- 
On the **Printer Management** page, you can see the printers that are set up. For more information, see [Set Up Printers](ui-specify-printer-selection-reports.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can't change the **Printer** field on the report request page. To use another printer, you must select it from the **Printer Management** page.
