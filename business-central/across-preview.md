### Building New Solutions and Intellectual Property

[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] offers a set of development tools and a modern platform to build on so you can create your own add-on apps and embed solutions to connect or extend [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  

For example, you can use an API to build a connected app to exchange data between [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and your payroll app. Connect apps can also make use of extensions to create pages to be used for setup, configuration, or to support app-specific features.
