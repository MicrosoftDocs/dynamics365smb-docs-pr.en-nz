# <a name="project-management"></a>Project Management

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can perform common project management tasks, such as configuring a project and scheduling a resource, as well as providing the information needed to manage budgets and monitor progress. You can track machine and employee hours on the project by using time sheets. As a project manager, you have a good overview, not only of individual projects, but also of the allocation of employees, machinery and other resources being used in all projects.

Before you can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to manage projects, you must set up resources, time sheets, and projects. For more information, see [Setting Up Project Management](projects-setup-projects.md).  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

Project management is complicated enough in itself, and learning how to create projects and managing work in process in a new tool can be another complication. To help you get started with project management in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can see [a video about creating projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqaPWr7BWmw) on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] YouTube channel.
