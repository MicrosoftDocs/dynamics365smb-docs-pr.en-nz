# <a name="project-management"></a>Project Management
In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can perform common project management tasks, such as configuring a job and scheduling a resource, as well as providing the information needed to manage budgets and monitor progress. You can track machine and employee hours on the project by using time sheets. As a project manager, you have a good overview, not only of individual jobs, but also of the allocation of employees, machinery and other resources being used in all projects.

Before you can use [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] to manage projects, you must set up resources, time sheets, and jobs. For more information, see [Setting Up Project Management](projects-setup-projects.md).  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

| To | See |
| --- | --- |
| Create jobs, assign job tasks, and prepare job planning lines. |[Create Jobs](projects-how-create-jobs.md) |
| Allocate resources to jobs and manage resource prices. |[Use Resources for Jobs](projects-how-use-resources.md) |
| Create a time sheet with integrated job task and planning lines and post time sheet lines to a job journal. |[Use Time Sheets for Jobs](projects-how-use-time-sheets.md) |
| Budget for resources to be used in jobs and compare actual item and resource usage to budgeted usage to improve the quality and cost efficiency of future projects. |[Manage Job Budgets](projects-how-manage-budgets.md) |
| Review and record usage on various parts of your job, which is automatically updated as you modify and transfer information from job planning lines to job journals or job invoices for posting. |[Record Usage for Jobs](projects-how-record-job-usage.md) |
| Purchase supplies for a job, either on purchase orders or invoices, and record item and time usage. |[Manage Job Supplies](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md) |
| Learn about WIP (Work in Process), a feature that ensures correct financial statements and enables you to estimate the financial value of jobs that are ongoing. |[Understanding WIP Methods](projects-understanding-wip.md) |
| Post the consumption of materials, resources, and other expenses of job work in process (WIP) to monitor its financial value and to maintain correct financial statements even though you post job expenses before invoicing the job. |[Monitor Job Progress and Performance](projects-how-monitor-progress-performance.md) |
| Record job costs for resource usage, materials, and job-related purchases on an on-going basis and invoice the customer, either when the job is finished or according to an invoicing schedule. |[Invoice Jobs](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md) |
