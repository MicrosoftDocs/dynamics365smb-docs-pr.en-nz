# <a name="use-power-automate-flows-in-prod_short"></a>Use Power Automate Flows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

You can use your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data as part of a workflow in Microsoft Power Automate. Create your own flows and connect to your data from internal and external sources with the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connector.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have a valid account with both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Power Automate.  

> [!TIP]
> In addition to Power Automate, you can use approval workflow templates in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Although they're two separate workflow systems, any approval workflow template you create with Power Automate is added to the list of workflows within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Workflows](across-workflow.md).

Power Automate flows are triggered by events such as record and document creation, modification, or deletion (automated flows). The flows can also run on a user-defined schedule (scheduled flows) or on demand (instant flows).

## <a name="power-automate-features-in-prod_short"></a>Power Automate features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

Flows expand on the built-in approval workflows features available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] without requiring coding knowledge, and can be associated with a wide range of events and responses, such as record changes, external files updates, posted documents, as well as different Microsoft and third-party services such as Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Dataverse, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Power Apps, and more.

So, for example, a new sales invoice can trigger a workflow for an approval request, which can have different events set depending on the approver's reply. A negative response sends a notification and email to the approval requester. A positive reply simultaneously updates an Excel spreadsheet located in a SharePoint folder and sends an update to a Teams chat.

Instant flows work similarly to batch shortcuts, performing multiple lengthy steps with a few button presses and are launched from specific pages or tables. For example, a flow can add a button to the action menu on the **Vendors** page to block payments to a vendor and, at the same time, send customisable emails to the vendor's contact and your company's purchasers as well as update the contact in Outlook.

## <a name="automated-workflows"></a>Automated workflows

With Power Automate, you can create business flows directly in-house and rely on citizen developers. Automated workflows can be started by both internal and external events in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and also be set to run periodically. Learn more and get instructions on how to create workflows in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

## <a name="instant-flows"></a>Instant flows

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can run a Power Automate flow from most list, card, and document pages. Once the admin has connected [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power Automate, you'll see any flows your organisation has added when you choose the **Automate** action on the relevant pages. Instant flows are run without leaving [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

These instant workflows open on a page inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online so you can remain within the context of the business process you were in the middle of. Choose the **Automate** action—on some pages nested under the **More Options** menu—choose the **Power Automate** menu item, then choose the relevant link to trigger the workflow. The connection to Power Automate is already set up for you.

Most flows require you to fill in a field or two before you choose the **Run flow** action.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see an **Automate** action, then your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] probably hasn't yet been set up to use Power Automate. Learn more from your admin.

## <a name="add-more-automated-flows-and-instant-flows"></a>Add more automated flows and instant flows

You can create flows through the [powerautomate.microsoft.com](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com) website. However, if your admin has switched on the capability to run Power Automate flows from inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can start the process of building a flow from the **Automate** action on the relevant pages, which can be found under the **More Options** menu depending on the page. Then choose the **Power Automate** menu item, and then choose the **Create a flow** action. Power Automate then opens in a new browser tab, and you're signed in automatically.

You can find sample templates to adapt to your company and all available trigger events, using both [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external tools, by choosing the **Connectors** menu on the Power Automate website. Learn more about available templates and triggers in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

## <a name="manage-automated-workflows"></a>Manage automated workflows

You can create new flows or manage existing Power Automate flows in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Manage Power Automate Flows** page. Learn more in the [Manage Power Automate Flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/manage-power-automate-flows) article in the administration content.

You can also manage available Power Automate workflows on the **Workflows** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The page lists both the built-in approval and Power Automate workflows, with options for the latter to enable/disable, delete, and view the workflow on the Power Automate website.
