# <a name="using-included365finincludesd365finmdmd-in-an-automated-workflow"></a>Using [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] in an Automated Workflow
You can use your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] data as part of a workflow in Microsoft Flow.  

> [!NOTE]  
>   You must have a valid account with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and with Flow.  

## <a name="to-add-included365finincludesd365finmdmd-as-a-data-source-in-flow"></a>To add [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] as a data source in Flow
1. In your browser, navigate to [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/), and then sign in.
2. Choose **My Flows** from the ribbon at the top of the page.
3. There are 2 ways to create a Flow; **Create from template** and **Create from blank**. A template is a predefined Flow that has been created for you.  To use a template, simply select it and create a connection for each service the template uses. A blank template enables you to create a new Flow completely from scratch.
4. To Create from blank, in the **My Flows** window, choose the **Create from blank** option.
5. Search for **Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]** connector.
6. From the list of available triggers, select one of the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] triggers available:  
    *When a customer approval is requested*,  
    *When a general journal batch approval is requested*,  
    *When a general journal line approval is requested*,  
    *When an item approval is requested*,  
    *When a purchase document approval is requested*,  
    *When a sales document approval is requested*, or  
    *When a vendor approval is requested*.
7. Flow will prompt you to select a company within your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] tenant, as well as any conditions in your data that you want to listen for.

At this point, you have successfully connected to your Business Central data and are ready to begin building your flow.

8. To Create from a template, choose the **Create from template** option.
9. Search for **Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]** templates.
10. From the list of available templates, select one of the templates.  
    *Request Approval for Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] sales order*,  
    *Request Approval for Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] sales quote*,  
    *Request Approval for Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] sales invoice*,  
    *Request Approval for Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] sales credit memo*,  
    *Request Approval for Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] customer*,  
    *Request Approval for Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] purchase order*,  
    *Request Approval for Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] purchase invoice*,  
    *Request Approval for Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] purchase credit memo*,  
    *Request Approval for Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] item*,  
    *Request Approval for Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] vendor*,  
    *Request Approval for Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] general journal batch*,  
    *Request Approval for Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] general journal lines*.  
11. Flow will prompt you to select a company within your [!INCLUDE[d365fin_md](includes/d365fin_md.md)] tenant. Because each step in the flow is independent of the next, you may be required to define the company multiple times when using a [!INCLUDE[d365fin_md](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Flow template.

> [!NOTE]  
> The [!INCLUDE[d365fin_md](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Flow template integrates with the core workflow engine in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_md](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. This means that each time you use one of these templates to create a flow, a corresponding workflow is created within [!INCLUDE[d365fin_md](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. Also, the person creating the flow must be set up as an approver in the Assisted Setup guide. For more information, see [Workflow](across-workflow.md).

For more information, see the [Flow Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/flow/getting-started).

For troubleshooting your Microsoft Flow, see [Troubleshooting Integration with Microsoft Flow](across-troubleshooting-how-use-financials-data-source-flow.md).
