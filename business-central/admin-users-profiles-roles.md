# <a name="understanding-users-profiles-and-role-centers"></a>Understanding Users, Profiles, and Role Centres
The people in your company who have access to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] are all assigned a *profile* that gives them access to a *Role Centre*. As an administrator, you can add and remove users as part of your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] subscription, and you can assign users permissions through user groups.  

## <a name="adding-users"></a>Adding Users
To add users in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], your company's Office 365 administrator must first create the users in the Office 365 Admin Centre. Then, the administrator can assign permissions to each user and groups of users. For more information, see [Managing Users and Permissions](ui-how-users-permissions.md).  

## <a name="profiles"></a>Profiles
Profiles are collections of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] users who share the same Role Centre.  A Role Centre is the entry point and home page for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] that gives you quick access to your most important tasks and displays various insights and key performance indicators (KPIs) about your work.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In the current version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you cannot add, edit, or delete profiles.

## <a name="configuration-and-personalization"></a>Configuration and Personalisation
<!--The concept of UI customization in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is divided in two:  

-   Configuration, performed by the administrator  

-   Personalization, performed by users  

The administrator configures the user interface for multiple users by customizing the user interface for a profile that the users are assigned to.  -->
Users personalise the user interface of their personal version by customising the user interface under their own user logon. This personalisation can be deleted by the administrator. For more information, see [Personalising Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).
