title: How to Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways | Microsoft Docs
description: When your location is setup to require put-away processing but not receive processing, you use the **Inventory Put-away** document to record and post put-away and receipt information for your source documents. The inbound source document can be a purchase order, a sales return order, an inbound transfer order, or a production order whose output is ready for put-away.
