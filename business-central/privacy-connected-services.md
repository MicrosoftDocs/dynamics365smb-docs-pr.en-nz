# Trial Features That Connect to Other Microsoft Services 

[!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] is a comprehensive business management solution that is deeply integrated with Microsoft 365 productivity apps and the Power Platform. Your free trial of Business Central can connect to many different Microsoft services that you must first configure and enable. To get the most out of your free trial, some of these features have been automatically enabled for you. Even though the connection from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is enabled, these services aren't included with your trial and must be purchased separately unless you have them already.

The table below indicates the connections to Microsoft services that are automatically enabled for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trials:

Make sure to confirm your organisationâ€™s policies and government compliance requirements for data residency before proceeding to use these features. 
> - You may affect services that aren't trials. If these services are used in production by your organisation and aren't being evaluated together with Business Central, other users of these services who aren't participating in this trial of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] may be affected.
> - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] may also connect to Microsoft services or third party services depending on the customisations and extensions that you or your administrator have installed in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial. For information about how your extensions process your data, contact the extension developer or follow the privacy link for the extension on AppSource.
