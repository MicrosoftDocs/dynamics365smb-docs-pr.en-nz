With Copilot in Business Central, small and medium-sized organisations empower their workers with intuitive AI tools that boost creativity and save time.

## Where can I find the list of Copilot features in Business Central?

## How does Copilot use the Azure AI time quota that comes with licences?

These features rely on Azure AI and aren't related to Copilot. The Dynamics 365 licensing guide indicates that 30 minutes of Azure AI time is included with Business Central licences. This quota refers to non-Copilot features where consumption of Azure AI time has no effect on Copilot in Business Central.

## Is Copilot in Business Central available worldwide?

To understand which Copilot features work with customisations, consult the articles for each feature.
