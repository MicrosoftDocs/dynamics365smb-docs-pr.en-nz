This article answers common questions about Microsoft Copilot in Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## <a name="what-is-copilot-in-business-central"></a>What is Copilot in Business Central?

With Copilot in Business Central, small and medium-sized organisations empower their workers through intuitive AI tools that boost creativity and save time.

## <a name="is-copilot-free"></a>Is Copilot free?

Currently, Copilot in Business Central is included with your Business Central licence at no extra cost. However, fair-use policies, quotas, or pricing might be introduced later.

## <a name="does-copilot-in-business-central-require-a-minimum-number-of-users"></a>Does Copilot in Business Central require a minimum number of users?

## <a name="how-does-copilot-use-the-azure-ai-time-quota-that-is-included-with-licenses"></a>How does Copilot use the Azure AI time quota that is included with licences?

Business Central offers numerous AI-powered features. Some features, such as sales and inventory forecasting, use specific machine learning models. These features rely on Azure AI and aren't related to Copilot. As the Dynamics 365 licensing guide indicates, 30 minutes of Azure AI time are included with Business Central licences. This quota refers to non-Copilot features, where consumption of Azure AI time has no effect on Copilot in Business Central.

## <a name="is-copilot-in-business-central-available-worldwide"></a>Is Copilot in Business Central available worldwide?

Copilot includes a constantly expanding set of capabilities that help users in different roles and tasks. Each Copilot capability defines its own list of supported regions and supported languages. Although most features might be available only in English at first, we aim to unlock more languages and regions over time. Learn more in [Copilot international availability](https://aka.ms/bapcopilot-intl-report-external).

## <a name="is-copilot-aware-of-my-environment-customizations"></a>Is Copilot aware of my environment customisations?

Some but not all Copilot features can work with your custom pages and tables. For example, you can use [analysis assist](analysis-assist.md) on your custom lists, or you can use [chat with Copilot](chat-with-copilot.md) to find records in custom tables.

## <a name="does-copilot-have-to-be-trained-on-my-data"></a>Does Copilot have to be trained on my data?

Copilot in Business Central relies on powerful AI foundation models that are coupled with data management features of the Business Central platform. No expensive or time-consuming training is needed before your organisation can start to use Copilot with your own company data.
