# <a name="block-customers"></a>Block Customers
You can block a customer, for example because of insolvency, so that the customer cannot be added to sales documents or so that no transactions can be posted for the customer.

In addition to blocking a customer, you can set receivable transactions for the customer to be on hold in connection with reminders. For more information, see [Collect Outstanding Balances](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md).   

The following table describes the different blocking options.  

|Option|Description|  
|--------------------|------------|  
|**Blank**|Transactions are allowed for this customer.|
|**Ship**|New orders and new shipments cannot be created for this customer. Existing shipments not yet invoiced can be invoiced.|  
|**Invoice**|New orders, new shipments, and new invoices cannot be created for this customer. Existing shipments not yet invoiced cannot be invoiced.|  
|**All**|No transaction is allowed for this customer, including payments.|
