Use statistical accounts to supplement information in financial reports. Statistical accounts let you add metrics that are based on non-transactional data. You add the non-transactional data as number-based units, such as:

* Employee headcount
* Square footage
* The number of customers with overdue accounts

For example, you can measure revenue or costs based on the number of people in a department. The headcount for the department is the unit for the statistical account. The following image shows an example of a report that uses a statistical account to show revenue per employee.

In terms of how they work, statistical accounts are similar to posting accounts. They store transactions that you post using statistical account journals, so that you can use the transactions as data for financial reports. To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reporting with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md). 

There are a couple of key differences between statistical accounts and posting accounts. Statistical accounts are separate entities, and aren't included in trial balance reports. Also, you don't need to balance debit and credit amounts when you use statistical account journals to post entries to a statistical account. You just post the amount.
