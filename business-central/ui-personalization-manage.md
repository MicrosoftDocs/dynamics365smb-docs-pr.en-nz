Users can personalise pages that make up their workspace to suit their own preferences. For more information, see [Personalise Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

Administrators can customise pages for a profile, according to the related business role or department, for example, so that all users that are assigned the profile will see the customised page layout. The administrator customises pages by using the same functionality as users do when they personalise pages.

> [!NOTE]
> The typical business use of a profile is a role. A profile is therefore named *Profile (Role)* in the UI.

Page customisation starts from the **Profiles (Roles)** page, the administrator's starting point for managing users' profiles on individual profile cards. In addition to customising the page layout, you control various other settings for profiles on the **Profile (Role)** page for each profile. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for the profile that you want to customise pages for, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. Choose the **Customise pages** action.

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens on a new browser tab for the selected profile with the **Customising** banner activated. The **Customising** banner offers the same functionality as the **Personalising** banner that is available to users.

4. Customise pages according to the needs of the role or department in question in the same way as a user would do when personalising. For more information, see [Personalise Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > To navigate during personalisation, use Ctrl + Click on an action if it is highlighted by the arrowhead.

5. When you have finished changing the layout on one or more pages, choose the **Done** button on the **Customising** banner.
6. Close the browser tab.

The customisation of pages is now recorded for the profile.

You can delete specific page personalisations with another action. For more information, see [To delete personalisations for specific pages](admin-users-profiles-roles.md#to-delete-personalizations-for-specific-pages).

1. On the **Profile (Role)** page, choose the **Manage customised pages** action.
