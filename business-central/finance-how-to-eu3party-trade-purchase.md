# EU third-party purchase transactions

European Union (EU) third-party trade occurs when you receive a purchase invoice from a customer in one EU country/region, and the products are sent to a different EU country/region without entering the country of residence. The transaction amount can be identified and reported separately to comply with some EU countries'/regions' value-added tax (VAT) reporting and VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) requirements. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central enables purchase transactions to be set up as EU third-party trade. Posted EU third-party transactions can be filtered in VAT statements and excluded from the amount in the **Sales to Customer** column of the **VAT-VIES Declaration Tax Auth** report.

Even if the feature is preinstalled as an extension, it isn't activated by default. Follow these steps to activate the feature.
