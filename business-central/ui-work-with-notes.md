# <a name="add-and-view-notes-on-records"></a>Add and View Notes on Records
 You <!--OnPrem and your colleagues -->can add notes to records in the application. Many windows, particularly those that display a list of records, such as the **Sales Orders** window, include the **Notes** action or the **Notes** FactBox. <!--OnPremNotes is where you can write notes about a record to yourself or others, and where you can view notes to you from others. For example, a note could be a general comment or processing instruction to your colleague, who can then respond to your note using their own **Notes**. Or, your colleague can add a note that gives you extra information about a sales order that is not covered by the information on the sales order. These notes and correspondences will follow the record as it is processed in the company.-->

<!--OnPrem
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can only select one recipient of the note.-->  

## <a name="to-work-with-notes-on-a-record"></a>To work with notes on a record

1.  Open a list of records, such as the **Sales Orders** window, or a card, such as the **Sales Order** window.  

    <!-- If **Notes** is not visible on the page, then you can customize the page to display the Notes FactBox. -->

2.  Choose the **Notes** action to open the **Notes** window. This window displays any current notes on the record. From here, you can do the following:

    -   To view or edit the note, choose **...** and then **Edit**. You can also do this from the **Notes** FactBox if it is available on the page.
    -   To add a note, choose the **+new** action, and then type your message in the **Note** box. You can enter a maximum of 30 lines of text in the note.

<!-- 5.  In the **To** field, enter a user ID (your own or someone elseâ€™s) to indicate who the note is for.  

6.  Select the **Notify** field if you want to send a notification to the user in the **To** field.

     If **Notify** is selected, the note will be sent as a notification to the user's **My Notifications** on the Role Center.  -->

3.  Choose the **OK** button.
