title: How to Move Items Ad Hoc in Basic Warehouse Configurations | Microsoft Docs
description: You may occasionally need to move items between internal bins, not receiving or shipping bins, without a specific demand from a source document. You may perform these ad hoc movements, for example, to reorganise the warehouse, to bring items to an inspection area, or to move additional items to and from a production area without a system relation to the production order source document.
