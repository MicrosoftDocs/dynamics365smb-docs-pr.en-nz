# Manage fixed assets

The Fixed Assets functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides an overview of your fixed assets and ensures correct periodic depreciation. It also enables you to keep track of your maintenance costs, manage insurance policies, post fixed asset transactions, and generate various reports and statistics.

## Video overview

The following video covers the basics of fixed assets:

## Fixed assets overview

For each fixed asset, you must set up a card containing information about the asset. You can set up buildings or production equipment as a main asset with a component list, and you can group them in various ways, such as by class, department, or location. Then you can begin to acquire, maintain, and sell the fixed assets. You can also set up budgeted assets. Budgeting lets you include any anticipated acquisitions and sales in reports.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you can manage fixed assets, you must complete the following setups:
>
> * Default values
> * Fixed asset accounting
> * Posting groups
> * Allocation keys
> * Fixed asset journals
>
> For more information, see [Setting Up Fixed Assets](fa-setup.md).

To track fixed asset depreciations and other financial transactions for fixed assets, set up one or more depreciation books for each one. Depreciation is done by running a report to calculate periodic depreciation, filling in a journal with the resulting entries, and then posting the journal. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports several depreciation methods. For more information, see [Depreciation Methods](fa-depreciation-methods.md). You can set up multiple depreciation books per fixed asset for different purposes, such as one for tax reporting and another for internal reporting.

For each asset, you can record maintenance costs and the next service date. Tracking maintenance expenses can be important for budgeting purposes and deciding whether to replace a fixed asset.

You can attach each fixed asset to one or more insurance policies, and verify that policy premiums align with the value of the assets.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can record fixed asset transactions on the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page or on the **Fixed Asset Journal** page, depending on whether the transactions are for financial reporting or for internal management. Help for Fixed Assets only describes how to use the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page. For more information, see [Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md).
