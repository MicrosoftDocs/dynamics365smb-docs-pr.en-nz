# Manage fixed assets

The fixed assets functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides an overview of your fixed assets and helps ensure that their depreciation is correct. It also enables you to track maintenance costs, manage insurance policies, post fixed asset transactions, and generate various reports and statistics.

## Video overview

The following video covers the basics of fixed assets:

## Initial setup of fixed assets

Before you can manage fixed assets, you must complete the following setups:

- Default values
- Fixed asset accounting
- Posting groups and types
- Allocation keys
- Fixed asset journals

To learn more, go to [Setting Up Fixed Assets](fa-setup.md).

## Fixed assets analytics

This section describes the analytical tools you can use to get insights into data about your fixed assets.

## Register fixed assets

For each fixed asset, you must set up a card that contains information about them. For example, you can set up buildings or production equipment as main assets with a component list. You can group assets in various ways, such as by class, department, or location. Then you can acquire, maintain, and sell the fixed assets. You can also set up budgeted assets. Budgeting lets you include any anticipated acquisitions and sales in reports.

## Set up depreciations for your fixed assets

To track fixed asset depreciations and other financial transactions for fixed assets, set up one or more depreciation books for each one. There are a few steps to depreciate assets:

1. Run a report to calculate periodic depreciation.
1. Fill in a journal with the resulting entries.
1. Post the journal.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports several depreciation methods. To learn more, go to [Depreciation Methods](fa-depreciation-methods.md). You can set up multiple depreciation books for each fixed asset for different purposes, such as one for tax reporting and another for internal reporting.

| Manually record fixed asset transactions on the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page or on the **Fixed Asset Journal** page, depending on whether the transactions are for financial reporting or for internal management. | [Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md) |

## Fixed assets maintenance and insurance

You can record maintenance costs and the next service date for each asset. Tracking maintenance expenses can be important for budgeting purposes and deciding whether to replace a fixed asset. You can attach each fixed asset to one or more insurance policies, and verify that policy premiums align with the value of the assets.
