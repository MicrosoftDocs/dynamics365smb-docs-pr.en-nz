# Monitor project progress and performance

With the work in process (WIP) feature you can estimate the financial value of ongoing projects in the general ledger.

As a project progresses, materials and resources are consumed and expenses incurred that must be posted to the project. In many cases, you might post expenses for a project before invoicing. But if only expenses have been posted, your financial statement is inaccurate. To track the actual value of the project, calculate WIP and post it to the general ledger. Learn more at [Understanding WIP Methods](projects-understanding-wip.md).

You can calculate WIP based on the following:

* Cost value
* Sales value
* Recognisable cost
* Percentage of completion
* Completed contract

<!--If you want to view the result using a different method, change the method and calculate WIP again. There's no limit to the number of times you calculate WIP; it doesn't get automatically posted to the general ledger. After you've calculated WIP using the method you prefer, you can post to the general ledger.-->

## Create a project WIP method

Create a project WIP method that meets the needs of your organisation and set it as the default.  

> [!NOTE]
> After you've used your new method to create WIP entries, you cannot modify or delete that method.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Methods**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Close the page.   
4. To make this new method the default, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects Setup**, then choose the related link.  
5. In the **Default WIP Method** field, choose the method from the list.

## Define a WIP method for a project

When you create a new project, you must specify which project WIP method applies. In some cases, the project WIP method you use is already set as the default.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action. Learn more at [Create Projects](projects-how-create-jobs.md).  
3. On the **Project Card** page, in the **WIP Method** field from the **Posting** FastTab, select a WIP method from the list. If a default method has been defined, you can select another option if needed.  

### Define a WIP method for a project task

You can define a WIP method for a project task, exclude project tasks from WIP calcualtion, or group tasks to be calculated together. 

If you want to calculate WIP for each project task individually, WIP posting provides defined dimensions for the specific tasks.

The **WIP-Total** specifies project tasks you want to group together when calculating WIP and recognition. In any group of tasks, there needs to be one task that satisfies two conditions:
<!--But doesn't the parenthetical below contradict this -* if there is no total, the application sets the total for you, meaning the condition does not HAVE to be satisfied, right? Or am I missing something?-->

* Has a **WIP-Total** set to *Total*. (If there are no project tasks with **WIP-Total** set to *Total*, *Total* is set automatically on the last project task line when WIP is calculated for the first time.)

* Has a **Project Task No.** number that's the final one in the group or range of project tasks.

The following table describes the three options:

| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| **\<blank\>** | Leave blank if the project task is part of a group of tasks. |
| **Total** | Defines the range or group of tasks included in the WIP and recognition calculation. Within the group, any project task with **Project Task Type** set to **Posting** is included in the WIP total, unless the task's **WIP-Total** field is set to **Excluded**. |
| **Excluded** | Applies only to a task with **Project Task Type** of **Posting**, in which case the task isn't included when WIP and recognition are calculated. |

In the following example, project tasks are divided into two WIP total groupings, demonstrating how the **WIP-Total** field works:

|Project task no.|Description|Project task type|**WIP-Total** field|  
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|  
|1000|Preparation|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1010|.    Cleaning|Posting|**Excluded**|
|1099|Total preparation|End-Total|\<blank\>|
|1100|Carpeting|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1110|.    Gluing floor|Posting|**Excluded**|
|1120|.    Laying out carpet|Posting|\<blank\>|
|1199|Total carpeting|End-Total|\<blank\>|
|1200|Finish|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1210|.    Vacuum cleaning carpet|Posting|\<blank\>|
|1299|Total finish|End-Total|**Total**|
|1300|Error correction|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1310|.    Error correction|Posting|\<blank\>|
|1399|Total error correction|End-Total|**Total**|

You'll notice:

* *1000* through *1299*: WIP is calculated separately for this group of project tasks. Note however, that two of the tasks, 1010 and 1110, are excluded from the WIP calculation because their project task type is **Posting**.

* *1300* through *1399*: WIP is calculated separately for this group of project tasks.

## Calculate WIP

You can determine the WIP amount to post to balance sheet accounts for the period end reporting. Use the **Project Calculate WIP** batch project to do this.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Calculate WIP**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate WIP** action.
3. On the **Project Calculate WIP** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The batch project only calculates the WIP, it does not post it to the general ledger. To post it, run the **Post WIP to G/L** batch project after you've calculated the WIP. Learn more in the following procedure.

## Post WIP

When you've calculated WIP, you can post it to balance sheet accounts for the period end reporting. You use the **Project Post WIP to G/L** batch project to do this.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Post WIP to G/L**,  then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Project Post WIP to G/L** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.

## Calculate and post project completion entries

When you have completed all activities for a project, including usage posting and invoicing, you must update the project's status to **Completed**. Then, you must reverse any WIP that has been posted to the general ledger.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select an open project, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Status** field, select **Completed**.
4. Follow the assistance steps to calculate and post the WIP, or follow steps 5 and 6 to do so manually.  
5. Choose the **Calculate WIP** action.
6. On the **Project Calculate WIP** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  

     The project WIP entries created by running the batch job will have the **Project Complete** checkbox selected to show that they're completion entries.  
7. Choose the **Post WIP to G/L** action.
8. On the **Project Post WIP to G/L** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  

     The project WIP general ledger entries created by running the batch project will have the **Project Complete** checkbox selected to show they're completion entries.

## View project ledger entries

All project-related entries are recorded in project registers and sequentially numbered, starting with 1. From the project register, you can get an overview of all project ledger entries.    

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Registers**, and choose the related link.
2. Select a relevant register, and then choose **Project Ledger** action.

On the **Project Ledger Entries** page you can review the entries that are associated with any project.
