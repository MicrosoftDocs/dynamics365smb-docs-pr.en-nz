# <a name="post-sepa-direct-debit-payment-receipts"></a>Post SEPA Direct Debit Payment Receipts
When a direct debit collection is successfully processed by your bank, you can proceed to post receipt of the payment for the involved sales invoices. For more information, see [Create SEPA Direct Debit Collection Entries and Export to a Bank File](finance-how-create-sepa-direct-debit-collection-entries-export-bank-file.md).  

You can post the payment receipt directly from the **Direct Debit Collections** window or the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** window. Alternatively, you can relay the work to another user by preparing the related journal lines.
