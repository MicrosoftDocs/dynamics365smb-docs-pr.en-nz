# Chat with Copilot FAQ

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article answers some common questions about chatting with Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For questions related to AI and chat, consult [Responsible AI FAQs for chat with Copilot](faqs-chat-with-copilot.md).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Can admins grant or deny permission to individual users to get access to chat?

No, there's no permission or permission set for chat. If chat is activated on the [Copilot and AI capabilities](enable-ai.md) page, every user in an environment has access to chat.
 
## Is chat available on tablet, phone, or other form factors?

No, the chat pane is only available on the [!INCLUDE[web_client](includes/web_client.md)] web client.

## I don't use Business Central in English. What are my options?

Currently, chat is only available in English. You can change your user language to English in [My Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language).

## What version of Business Central do I need for chat?

Chat is available in public preview from version 24.0 (2024 release wave 1).

## Does chat work with my customisations?

It depends on the type of question you ask Copilot. For example:

- If you ask questions to find records, it can find records in your custom tables that use custom fields.
- If you ask Copilot for an explanation or guidance, it doesn't have access to any information about your customisations or documentation for your add-ons.

## How do I open a record or page with chat?

When you ask Copilot to find records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], it shows any records it finds as selectable tiles or links in the chat pane. While in preview, Copilot doesn't automatically navigate to any page.

## Why do I get different answers from Copilot for the same question?

Copilot might occasionally answer in different ways. Answers aren't always identical.

## How do I use the Copy function on chat messages?

You can use the Copy button to copy a message from earlier in your conversation with Copilot, paste it into the input box to try again or try a variation of your message to Copilot.

## Can I customise or extend chat?

While in preview, the chat pane and Copilot's responses can't be modified in any way through customisation, add-ins, or personalisation.

## Does Copilot search for data in other companies or environments?

Copilot only searches for records in the company you're currently signed into. It doesn't search for data across multiple environments or companies.

## What can I do if the chat pane doesn't show?

Check that your user language in **My Settings** is set to English, and that your environment is of version 24.0 or later. On the Copilot and AI Capabilities page, make sure the administrator has switched on consent for data across geographies and has activated chat. Also, make sure your environment localisation isn't Canada.

If you still don't see the chat with Copilot feature, it's possible that Microsoft is still rolling the feature out to your region. Copilot rolled out to US customers first in April 2024, and then over the course of weeks will roll out to other country/region localisations.

## Why does Copilot only show three records in the Chat pane?

When you ask Copilot to find records, the way you phrase the question determines how Copilot identifies and applies filters on pages to find what you are looking for. To keep answers concise, the Chat pane displays a maximum of three record tiles, even when Copilot finds more relevant records.

## Why does Copilot give incorrect answers to calculations?

While in preview, Chat with Copilot can help you find records, explain concepts, and guide you to how to complete tasks in Business Central. Other use cases aren't supported, such as adding up a field across records or calculating the average monthly amount. We hope to add basic mathematics abilities to Copilot in the future.

## Can I use speech instead of typing my prompts?

You can chat with Copilot by using voice typing to talk instead of type your words in the Chat pane. Voice typing uses online speech recognition and is available with Windows. To use voice, activate the chat message box, then use the <kbd>Windows</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> shortcut and start speaking. For more information, see [Use voice typing to talk instead of type on your PC](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/use-voice-typing-to-talk-instead-of-type-on-your-pc-fec94565-c4bd-329d-e59a-af033fa5689f).
