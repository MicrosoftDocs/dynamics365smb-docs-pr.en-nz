# Chat with Copilot FAQ

[!INCLUDE[preview-banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article answers some common questions about chatting with Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For questions related to AI and chat, consult [Responsible AI FAQs for chat with Copilot](faqs-chat-with-copilot.md).

[!INCLUDE[production-ready-preview-dynamics365](includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Can admins grant or deny permission to individual users to get access to chat?

No, there's no permission or permission set for chat. If chat is activated on the [Copilot and AI capabilities](enable-ai.md) page, every user in an environment has access to chat.
 
## Is chat available on tablet, phone, or other form factors?

No, the chat pane is only available on the [!INCLUDE[web_client](includes/web_client.md)] web client.

## I don't use Business Central in English. What are my options?

At this time, chat is only available in English. You can change your user language to English in [My Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language).

## Which Business Central version do I need to experience chat?

Chat is available in public preview from version 24.0 (2024 release wave 1).

## Does chat work with my customisations?

It depends on the type of question you ask Copilot. For example:

- When you ask questions to locate records, Copilot is able to find records in your custom tables that are identified using custom fields.
- When you ask for an explanation or guidance, Copilot doesn't have access to any information about your customisations or documentation for your add-ons.

## Copilot never seems to open the record or page I asked for. What am I doing wrong?

When you ask Copilot to find records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], it displays any records it finds as selectable tiles or links in the chat pane. While in preview, Copilot doesn't automatically navigate to any page.

## The answers I get from Copilot vary even though I ask the same question. Is it a bug?

Copilot might occasionally answer in different ways. Answers aren't necessarily identical.

## When should I use the Copy function on chat messages?

You can use the Copy button to copy a message from earlier in your conversation with Copilot, paste it into the input box to try again or try a variation of your message to Copilot.

## How do I customise or extend chat?

While in preview, the chat pane and Copilot's responses can't be modified in any way through customisation, add-ins, or personalisation.

## Does Copilot find data in other companies or environments?

Copilot only searches for records in the company you're currently signed into&mdash;even if your organization uses multiple environments or companies to segregate data.

## The Copilot chat pane doesn't show. What can I do?

Check that your user language in My Settings is set to English, and that your environment is of version 24.0 or later. In the Copilot and AI Capabilities page, make sure administrators have switched on consent for data across geographies and have activated chat. Make sure your environment localization isn't Canada.

If you still don't see the chat with Copilot feature, it's possible that Microsoft is still rolling the feature out to your region. Copilot rolls out to US customers first in April 2024, and then over the course of weeks will roll out to other country/region localizations.

## Why does Copilot only show three records in the Chat pane?

When you ask Copilot to retrieve records, the way you formulate the question determines how Copilot identifies and applies filters on pages to find what you are looking for. To keep answers compact and concise, the Chat pane displays a maximum of three record tiles, even when Copilot finds a larger number of relevant records.

## Copilot returns incorrect answers to totals and other calculations

While in preview, Chat with Copilot can locate records, explain concepts, and guide you to how to complete tasks in Business Central. Other use cases aren't supported, such as adding up a field across records or calculating the average monthly amount. We hope to add basic mathematics abilities to Copilot in the future.

## Can I use speech instead of typing my prompts?

You can chat with Copilot by using voice typing to talk instead of type your words in the Chat pane. Voice typing uses online speech recognition and is available with Windows. To use voice, activate the chat message box, then use the <kbd>Windows</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> shortcut and begin speaking. For more information, see [Use voice typing to talk instead of type on your PC](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/use-voice-typing-to-talk-instead-of-type-on-your-pc-fec94565-c4bd-329d-e59a-af033fa5689f).
