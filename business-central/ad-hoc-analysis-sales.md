# <a name="ad-hoc-analysis-of-sales-data"></a>Ad-hoc analysis of sales data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyse sales data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarise, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "My customers" or "Sales statistics," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyse list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of sales processes:

- [Sales Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305)
- General Ledger Entries
- [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25)
- Item Ledger Entries
- Posted Sales Invoices
- Sales Return Orders

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of sales scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |

1. Turn on **Pivot** mode (located directly above the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Sell-to Customer Name**, **Sell-to Customer No.**, and **No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. Drag the field **Amount** field to the **Values** area.

1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Additional Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Expected sales volume** or something that describes this analysis for you.

After you enter information on a sales order and add all the sales order lines, you can post the order. Posting creates a shipment and an invoice. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the customer's account, general ledger, and item ledger entries:

- For each sales order, a sales entry is created on the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the customer's account in the **Cust. Ledger Entry** table and a general ledger entry is created in the relevant receivables account. In addition, posting the order might result in a GST entry and a general ledger entry for the discount amount.
- For each sales order line, an item ledger entry is created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the sales lines contain item numbers) or a general ledger entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table (if the sales lines contain a general ledger account). In addition, sales orders are always recorded in the **Sales Shipment Header** and **Sales Invoice Header** tables.

To learn more about posting sales, go to [Posting sales](ui-post-sales.md).
