### User Account Settings
Integration with Business Central through Dataverse requires an administrator user account and an account that is used only for the connection between the apps. This account is called the "integration user." When you install the CDS Base Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. If those permissions are changed you might need to reset them. You can do that by reinstalling the Integration Solution or by manually resetting them. The following tables list the minimum permissions for the user accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  -->
