# <a name="set-up-workflow-users"></a>Set Up Workflow Users
Before you can create workflows, you must set up the users who take part in workflows. This is necessary, for example, to specify who will receive a notification to act on a workflow step.  

On the **Workflow User Group** page, you set up users under workflow user groups, and you specify the usersâ€™ number in a process sequence, such as an approver chain.  

Workflow users that function as approval users, both approval requesters and approvers, must also be set up on the **Approval User Setup** page. For more information, see [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  To define that an approval request is not approved until multiple approvers in an approval chain have approved it, set up approvers in a hierarchy. For approver type **Approver**, set approvers up on the **Approval User Setup** page. For approver type, **Workflow User Group**, set approvers up on the **Workflow User Groups** page and define the hierarchy by assigning incremental numbers to each approver in the **Sequence No.** field. For more information, see [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md) and this topic.  
>   
>  To define that an approval request is not approved until multiple equal approvers have approved it, regardless of a hierarchy, set up a flat workflow user group. For approver type, **Workflow User Group**, set up approvers on the **Workflow User Groups** page and assign the same number to each approver in the **Sequence No.** field. For more information, see this topic.  

### <a name="to-set-up-a-workflow-user"></a>To set up a workflow user  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflow User Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **Workflow User Group** page opens.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter a maximum of 20 characters to identify the workflow.  
4. In the **Description** field, describe the workflow.  
5. On the **Workflow User Group Members** FastTab, fill the fields on the first line as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**User Name**|Specify the user who will take part in workflows.<br /><br /> The user must exist on the **User Setup** page. For more information, see [Managing Users and Permissions](ui-how-users-permissions.md).|  
    |**Sequence No.**|Specify the order in which the workflow user engages in a workflow relative to other users. This field can be used, for example, to specify when the user approves relative to other approvers when you use the **Workflow User Group** option in the **Approver Type** field on the related workflow response. **TIP:**  To define that an approval request is not approved until multiple equal approvers have approved it, irrespective of a hierarchy, set up a flat workflow user group by assigning the same sequence number to the relevant approvers.|  
6. Repeat step 5 to add more workflow users to the user group.  
7. Repeat steps 2 through 6 to add more workflow user groups.
