<!--## Company details

In the **Company Hub** page, you can see more information about each company by choosing the name of the company that you want to learn more about. This opens the **Company Details** pane, where you can see additional information, such as the following:  

* Cash account balances  
* Cash flow forecast  
* Overdue purchase invoices  
* Overdue sales invoices  

> [!TIP]
> You can launch predefined Excel workbooks from the **Reports** tab in the ribbon. These Excel workbooks are designed as ready-to-print key financial statements and reports, but you can also modify them to fit your needs. For more information, see [Analyzing Financial Statements in Microsoft Excel](finance-analyze-excel.md).  

Otherwise, close the details pane and continue to the next company.  -->
