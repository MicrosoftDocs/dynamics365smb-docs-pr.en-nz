When you use RapidStart Services, we recommend that you use the RapidStart Services Implementer Role Centre as it provides the correct context for your configuration work. For more information, see [To change the role](ui-change-basic-settings.md#to-change-the-role).

As you continue with your work, you can assign each table the status that reflects where you are in the process. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] then keeps track of the table status in the **Activities** part on the Role Centre.  

By default, when you add a table to the configuration worksheet, its status is set to blank. This means that configuration of the table has not begun. This is reflected in the **Not Started** count in the **Activities** tile.  

## <a name="to-update-the-status-of-a-configuration-table"></a>To update the status of a configuration table  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Configuration Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Edit List** action.  
3.  Select a table, and in the **Status** field, choose the appropriate status.  
4.  Choose the **OK** button.  

When you return to the Role Centre, the tiles in the **Activities** part are updated to reflect your changes.  

## <a name="to-track-the-status-of-a-configuration-project"></a>To track the status of a configuration project  
- Open the RapidStart Services Role Centre.  

In the **Configuration Areas** part, completion statistics are shown for the areas and groups that you have set up. If you have not set up any groups or areas, this part has no data.  

## <a name="to-see-a-filtered-view-of-table-status"></a>To see a filtered view of table status  
1. Choose the **Tables** action.  
2. Select the appropriate filtered view.
