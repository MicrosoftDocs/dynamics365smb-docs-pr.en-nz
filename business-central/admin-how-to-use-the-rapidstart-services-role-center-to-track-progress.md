When you use RapidStart Services, we recommend that you use the RapidStart Services Implementer Role Centre as it provides the correct context for your configuration work. For more information, see the "To change Role Centre" section in [Changing Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

As you continue with your work, you can assign each table the status that reflects where you are in the process. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] then keeps track of the table status in the **Activities** part on the Role Centre.  

By default, when you add a table to the configuration worksheet, its status is set to blank. This means that configuration of the table has not begun. This is reflected in the **Not Started** count in the **Activities** tile.  

## <a name="to-update-the-status-of-a-configuration-table"></a>To update the status of a configuration table  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Configuration Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Edit List** action.  
3.  Select a table, and in the **Status** field, choose the appropriate status.  
4.  Choose the **OK** button.  

When you return to the Role Centre, the tiles in the **Activities** part are updated to reflect your changes.  

## <a name="to-track-the-status-of-a-configuration-project"></a>To track the status of a configuration project  
- Open the RapidStart Services Role Centre.  

In the **Configuration Areas** part, completion statistics are shown for the areas and groups that you have set up. If you have not set up any groups or areas, this part has no data.  

## <a name="to-see-a-filtered-view-of-table-status"></a>To see a filtered view of table status  
1. Choose the **Tables** action.  
2. Select the appropriate filtered view.
