title: Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together | Microsoft Docs
description: If an assembly item is set up for assemble-to-stock, then the default sales order process assumes that the item is already assembled and can be picked from inventory, if it is available. But if a part (or all) of the quantity is not available, then you have the flexibility to create an assembly order for the remaining quantity on the fly.
