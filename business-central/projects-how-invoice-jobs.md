# Invoice Projects

During the project, project costs from resource usage, materials, and project-related purchases can accumulate. As the project progresses, these transactions get posted to the project journal. It is important that all costs get recorded in the project journal before you invoice the customer.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also purchase external resources unrelated to a project, for example, to invoice a vendor for work delivered. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

You can invoice the whole project from the **Project Task Lines** page or only invoice selected billable lines from the **Project Planning Lines** page. Invoicing can be done after the project is finished or at certain intervals during the project's progress based on an invoicing schedule.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you select **Billable** in the **Project Line Type** field on the purchase documents for project-related purchases, then project planning lines that are ready to be invoiced to the customer are created. For more information, see [Manage Project Supplies](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md).

You can also invoice a company that is not the end customer. Sometimes the party that a project is for is different from the party that is paying the bill. On the **Projects** page, you can specify the customer who will benefit from the project in the **Sell-to** fields, and the party to invoice in the **Bill-to** fields.

## To create multiple project sales invoices

You can create an invoice for a project or for one or more project tasks for a customer when either the work to be invoiced is complete or the date for invoicing based on an invoicing schedule has been reached.

The following procedure shows how to use a batch job to invoice multiple projects.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Create Sales Invoice**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Set filters if you want to limit the projects that the batch job will process.
4. Choose the **OK** button to create the invoices.  

You can review and post created invoices in the **Sales Invoices** window.

> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively, invoice a customer by selecting the project, and then choosing the **Create Sales Invoice** action. 

## To create and post project sales invoice from project planning lines

You can create an invoice from a project planning lines, and indicate at that time the quantity of the item, resource, or general ledger account that you want to invoice.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project.
3. Select a project task for which the **Project Task Type** field contains **Posting**, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
4. On a project planning line, in the **Qty. To Transfer to Invoice** field, enter the quantity of the item, resource, general ledger account type that you want to invoice.  
5. Choose the **Create Sales Invoice** action.
6. On the **Project Transfer to Sales Invoice** page, enter the posting date and whether you want to create a new invoice or append this invoice to an existing one.
7. Choose the **OK** button.
