In some countries or regions, accounting software must be certified to comply with local tax regulation and financial requirements. Some countries exercize this as a yearly recurring requirement and others as a one-off requirement to comply with. Below is a list of the current countries/regions where Business Central has achieved certifications.

> [!NOTE]
> Only some countries have this requirement.

- France (Tax Audit Certification) [(link to certification in French)](https://certificates.infocert.org/certificates/CERTIF-07-181-R16.pdf)
