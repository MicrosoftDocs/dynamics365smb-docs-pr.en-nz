# <a name="managing-contacts"></a>Managing Contacts
Employees in your company regularly meet prospective business relations that may develop into formal relationships. All such external contacts and their detailed information should be recorded in the system so that communication is more successful and so they can easily be converted to formal customer, vendor, or bank relationships.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
