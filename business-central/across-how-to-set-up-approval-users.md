# <a name="set-up-approval-users"></a>Set Up Approval Users

Before you can create workflows that involve approval steps, you must set up the users who are involved in approval processes on the **Approval User Setup** page. You can also set amount limits for different types of requests, define substitute approvers, and set up notifications.  

After you set up approval users, you can create workflow responses for approval workflows. Learn more at [Create Approval Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can require that multiple approvers react to an approval request by creating a group of approvers on the **Workflow User Group** page. Learn more at [Set Up Workflow User Groups](across-how-to-set-up-workflow-users.md).  

## <a name="to-set-up-an-approval-user"></a>To set up an approval user

[!INCLUDE [workflow-requestor-approver](includes/workflow-requestor-approver.md)]

   |-----|-----------|
   |**User ID**|Select the user ID of the person involved in the approval process.|
   |**Salespers./Purch. Code**|Specify the salesperson or purchaser code that applies to the user.<br /><br /> You typically fill in the **Salespers./Purch. Code** field if the salesperson or purchaser responsible for the customer or vendor is also the person who must approve a sales or purchase request.|
   |**Approver ID**|Select the user ID of the person who must approve requests made by the person you specified in the **User ID** field.|
   |**Sales Amount Approval Limit**|Specify the maximum sales amount in local currency (LCY) that the person selected in the **User ID** field can approve.|
   |**Unlimited Sales Approval**|Specify that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve all sales requests regardless of the amount.<br /><br /> If you select this checkbox, you can't fill in the **Sales Amount Approval Limit** field.|

   |**Unlimited Purchase Approval**|Specify that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve all purchase requests regardless of the amount.<br /><br /> If you select this checkbox, you can't fill in the **Purchase Amount Approval Limit** field.|

   |**Substitute**|Select the user ID of the person who will approve requests made by the person identified in the **User ID** field if the user in the **Approver ID** isn't available. <br /><br />**Note:**  The substitute can either be the user in the **Substitute** field, the direct approver, or the approval administrator, in that order of priority. Learn more at [Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md).|
   |**Email**|Specify the email address of the person in the **User ID** field.|
   |**Approval Administrator**|Specify the user who has permission to unblock approval workflow, such as by delegating approval requests to new substitute approvers or deleting overdue approval requests.<br /><br />**Note** Only one person can be the approval administrator.|

3. To test the approval user setup, choose the **Approval User Setup Test** action.  
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for every person you want to set up as an approval user.  

The next step is to specify how you want [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to notify people that a request is pending their attention. Learn more at [Setting Up Workflow Notifications](across-setting-up-workflow-notifications.md).
