# <a name="adding-links-to-websites-documents-or-programs-on-records"></a>Adding Links to Websites, Documents, or Programs on Records
On a specific record, such as a customer, document, or sales order, you can add a link to an external document, website, or programme. Or, you may want a link that opens a new empty email to a specific recipient when you select it. The card page for some records, such as customer and vendor cards, include a **Home Page** field where you can enter an Internet address (URL). To include other links, you can use the method described in this article.

Another example could be when you receive printed invoices from vendors. You can scan them and store them as .pdf files on a SharePoint site. Then you can make a link from a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_md](includes/d365fin_md.md)] to the corresponding invoice on  SharePoint. Or, you can make a link from an item card to the corresponding page in your vendor's online catalogue.

## <a name="to-add-a-link-on-a-record"></a>To add a link on a record   

1.  Open the record that you want to attach the link to, such as a customer card or sales order. If you want to attach the link to a specific line, such as a journal line, select the line.  

2.  Choose the **Links** action to open the **Links** windows that shows all the current links that are added to the record.

3. To add a new link, choose **+new**.

4.  In the **Link Address** field, enter

    -   To link to a file on your computer or network, enter the full path and file name, such as  **C:My Documentsinvoice1.doc**.
    -   To link to website, enter the Internet address (URL), such as **www.microsoft.com**.
    -   To link to website, enter the Internet address (URL), such as **www.microsoft.com**.
    -   To link to a programme, enter a specific string to open the programme. For example, to open OneNote with a specific page, enter **onenote:///C:My Documentstest.one**. Or, to open Outlook with a new empty email to a specific alias, enter **mailto:testalias**.  

5.  Fill in the **Description** field with information about the link.  

6.  Choose the **Save** button.  

## <a name="to-delete-a-link-from-a-record"></a>To delete a link from a record  

To delete a link, in the **Links** window, you can select **...** and then **Delete**.

If you delete a single record, such as a sales order line, a sales order, or a customer, then all the links attached to the record are deleted. However, if you delete records using a batch job, such as the **Delete Invoiced Sales Orders** batch job, then the links are still stored in the database. To delete the links from the database, run the **Delete Orphaned Record Links** codeunit. To do this, choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Delete Orphaned Record Links**, and then choose the related link.   

<!-- ### To run delete orphaned record links  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Data Deletion**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  On the **Data Deletion** page, choose **Tasks**, and then choose **Delete Orphaned Record Links**.  -->
