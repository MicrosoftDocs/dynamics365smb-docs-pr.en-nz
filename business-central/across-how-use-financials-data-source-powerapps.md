# <a name="connecting-to-your-business-central-data-to-build-a-business-app-using-power-apps"></a>Connecting to Your Business Central Data to Build a Business App Using Power Apps

You can make your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data available as a data source in Power Apps.  

> [!TIP]  
> Business Central now offers development and operations support for Power Platform in AL-Go and samples to get you started creating your own apps with Power Apps. These features are currently in preview. To learn more, go to [Business Central and Power Apps](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-apps-overview) in the developer and IT pro help.

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

You must have a valid account with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and with Power Apps.  

## <a name="add--as-a-data-source-in-power-apps"></a>Add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in Power Apps

These steps add a Business Central table, like customers or items, as the data source of a Power Apps app.

1. In your browser, go to [powerapps.microsoft.com](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/), and then sign in.
2. In the navigation pane on the left side, select **+ Create**, and then select **More data sources** on the **Create app** page.
  
   <!-- This step opens Power Apps canavs. On first sign-in, you must specify the country/region.  -->
3. The **Connections** the list shows any existing data connections you have.

   - If there's a **Business Central** connection already, select it, and then select **Create**.

   - If you don't see a Business Central connection, select **+ New connection**, search for and select **Business Central**, and then select **Create**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you want to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, then you must choose the **Business Central (on-premises)** connector.  
  
4. Power Apps connects to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Sign in using the Business Central account name and password. If you aren't an administrator of your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you may have to sign in with another account.  
5. Once you've signed in, Power Apps displays a list of *Environments and companies* that are available from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Choose the environment and company that contains the data you want to connect to, such as *PRODUCTION - My Company*.  
6. Next, you're presented with a list of tables that are exposed as part of the API for your environment. Select the table that you want to connect to, and then choose **Connect**.

These so-called tables are exposed as endpoints by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connector for Power Apps.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to include data from other tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in your app, then you must work with a developer to define a custom API in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

At this point, you have successfully connected to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data and are ready to begin building your Power App. You can always add more screens and connect to more data. Learn more at [Create a canvas app from a sample in Power Apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/open-and-run-a-sample-app).  

When you have designed and built your app, you can share it with your colleagues. For more information, see [Save and publish a canvas app in Power Apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/save-publish-app).

## <a name="sample-apps-to-get-started"></a>Sample apps to get started

As a preview version, Business Central offers several sample apps that you can use as a starting point for building your own apps that use Business Central data. These sample apps are available in the [Business Central Demos](https://github.com/BusinessCentralDemos) repo on GitHub. For a quick overview on the apps, go to [Power Apps samples for Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-apps-samples).
