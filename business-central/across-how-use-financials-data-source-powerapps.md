# <a name="connecting-to-your-business-central-data-to-build-a-business-app-using-power-apps"></a>Connecting to Your Business Central Data to Build a Business App Using Power Apps

You can make your [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] data available as a data source in Power Apps.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must have a valid account with [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] and with Power Apps.  

## <a name="to-add-prodshort-as-a-data-source-in-power-apps"></a>To add [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] as a data source in Power Apps

1. In your browser, navigate to [powerapps.microsoft.com](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/), and then sign in.
2. On the Home page, choose the **Apps**, **Create an app** and **Canvas** to create a new canvas app. This app will be designed for use on a mobile device, but you can also choose to use another template.

    The next step to create a Power App is to select your data. Choose the Arrow icon then choose the **New connection** option in the upper left side of the page.
3. In the list of available connections, choose **Business Central**, and then choose the **Create** button.

    Power Apps will connect to your [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] using the credentials that you are signed in with. If you are not an administrator of your [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], you may have to sign in with another account.  

4. Power Apps will display a list of *Environments and companies* that are available from [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]. Choose the environment and company that contains the data you want to connect to. Next, you will be presented with a list of APIs. Select the **API** you want to connect to.

These so-called tables are part of the [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] API. You do not have to configure the end points yourself - the [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] connector for Power Apps does it for you.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to include data from other tables in [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] in your app, then you must work with a developer to define a custom API in [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] and then consume that custom API through a custom connector in Power Apps. For more information, see [Create a custom connector from scratch](/connectors/custom-connectors/define-blank).  

At this point, you have successfully connected to your [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] data and are ready to begin building your PowerApp. You can add additional screens and connect to additional data from your [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]. For more information, see [Create a canvas app from a template in Power Apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/get-started-test-drive).  

When you have designed and built your app, you can share it with your colleagues. For more information, see [Save and publish a canvas app in Power Apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/save-publish-app).  

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to connect to [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] on-premises, then you must choose the **Business Central (on-premises)** connector in step 3.
