# <a name="introduction-to--and-power-bi"></a>Introduction to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Power BI

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

It's easy to get insights into your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data with [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) - a data visualization system from Microsoft. Power BI retrieves [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data so that you can build dashboards and reports based on that data. Power BI provides a flexible alternative to reports built in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], enabling you drill down and customise the visualisation, and even merge data from different companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Some Power BI reports can also be embedded in Business Central and viewed without leaving the system. More complex dashboards are better experienced from the Power BI web site.

## <a name="what-you-can-do-with-power-bi-and-"></a>What you can do with Power BI and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

There are various features for working with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Power BI. Some things you can do from Power BI, while other things are done from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Also, some features are only available with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, not on-premises. The following table gives you an overview.

## <a name="get-ready-to-use-power-bi"></a>Get ready to use Power BI

There are a few tasks that must be done before you can start using Power BI with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. <!-- Some of the tasks are typically only done by administrators or super users.--> The tasks will depend on your role in your organisation, and what you want to do with Power BI:

- As a *business user*, you want to view Power BI reports, either in the Power BI Service or in Business Central
- As an *administrator*, you're responsible for the management of the organisation-wide settings that control how Business Central and Power BI work.
- As a *report creator*, you want to build custom Power BI reports that you can share with other users.

## <a name="track-your-business-kpis-with-power-bi-metrics"></a>Track your business KPIs with Power BI metrics

If you use Power BI on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, it's easy to track KPIs or metrics that are important to you. 

With metrics in Power BI, you can curate your own metrics and track them against key business objectives, in a single pane. This feature enhances data culture by promoting accountability, alignment, and visibility for teams and initiatives within organisations. 

Follow this four-step process to setup Power BI metrics:

1. Create a scorecard in the Power BI service. Learn more at [Create scorecards in Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create).  
2. Add the _metrics_ you want to track by connecting to your Power BI report on telemetry. Learn more at [Create connected metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create-connected).  
3. To add alerting, define status rules for your metrics. Learn more at [Create automated status rules for metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-metrics-status-rules).  

    This step will automate status updates based on rules that govern that metric. Rules trigger changes based on value, percentage of target met, date conditions, or a combination of the three, making the rules as versatile as possible. For connected metrics, these status rules are refreshed every time the data in your scorecard is refreshed.
4. Finally, follow metrics to get alerts in Teams or by email. Learn more at [Follow your metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-metrics-follow).  

Learn more about Power BI metrics at [Get started with metrics in Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-introduction).

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Business Central 2023 release wave 2, it's possible to embed scorecards from Power BI metrics in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
