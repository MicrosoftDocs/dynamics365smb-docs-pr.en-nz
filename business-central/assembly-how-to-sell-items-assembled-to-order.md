title: How to Sell Items Assembled to Order | Microsoft Docs
description: If the item is set up for assemble-to-order, then the item is not expected to be in inventory, and it must be assembled specifically to a sales order. When you enter the item on a sales order line, then an assembly order is automatically created and linked to the sales order.
