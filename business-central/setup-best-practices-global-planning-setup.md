|Use Forecast on Locations|Select if you have forecasts for specific locations.||  
|Components at Location|If items are not defined as SKUs, select the location code of your main warehouse.|This also applies if you only use the requisition worksheet.|  
|Blank Overflow Level|Select **Allow Default Calculation** if you are migrating from Microsoft Dynamics NAV 5.0 or earlier.|Use only if you want to allow all or some of your items to overflow the reorder point.|  
|Default Dampener Period|Set between 1D and 5D.<br /><br /> If new to planning in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], then set a longer period.|When users are more familiar with the different reasons for action messages, then shorten the dampener period to allow more change suggestions.|
