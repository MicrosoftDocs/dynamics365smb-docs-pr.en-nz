More and more growing businesses are changing from finance apps like QuickBooks Desktop and QuickBooks Online, which are designed for startups and other small businesses, to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which also supports larger, more complex organisations. 

As they transition, companies typically want to bring their business data with them so they don't start from scratch. To help transfer data, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers built-in extensions that migrate data such as customers, vendors, inventory items, and general ledger accounts. The following extensions are installed and ready to go as an integrated part of the **Data Migration** assisted setup guide:

* QuickBooks Data Migration 
* QuickBooks Online Data Migration

For more information, read about the extension that suits your QuickBooks app:
