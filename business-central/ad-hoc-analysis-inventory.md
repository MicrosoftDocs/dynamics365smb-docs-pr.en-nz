# <a name="ad-hoc-analysis-of-inventory-data"></a>Ad-hoc analysis of inventory data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyse inventory data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarise, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "expiring stock" or "top sellers," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyse list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of inventory processes:

- [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38)

## <a name="inventory-ad-hoc-analysis-scenarios"></a>Inventory ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of inventory scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When you post a sales order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the customer's account, general ledger, and item ledger entries.

- For each sales order line, an item ledger entry is created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the sales lines contain item numbers). In addition, sales orders are always recorded in the **Sales Shipment Header** and **Sales Invoice Header** tables. To learn more about posting sales, go to [Posting sales](ui-post-sales.md).

When you post a purchase document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the vendor's account, general ledger (G/L), item ledger entries, and resource ledger entries.

- For each purchase line, as applicable, entries are created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the purchase line is of the Item type). In addition, purchase documents are always recorded in the **Purch. Recpt. Header** and **Purch. Inv. Header** tables. To learn more, go to [Posting purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#posting-purchases).
