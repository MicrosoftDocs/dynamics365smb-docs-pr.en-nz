# <a name="setting-up-or-changing-the-chart-of-accounts"></a>Setting Up or Changing the Chart of Accounts
The chart of accounts shows the ledger accounts that store your financial data. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] includes a standard chart of accounts that is ready to support your business.
However, you can change the default accounts, and you can add new accounts.  

## <a name="adding-or-changing-accounts"></a>Adding or Changing Accounts
From the chart of accounts, you can open each G/L account and add or change settings.

> [!NOTE]  
>   You can delete a general ledger account. However, before you delete it, the following must be true:  

* The balance on the account must be zero.  
* The **Allow G/L Acc. Deletion Before** field must be set in the **General Ledger Setup** window, and the account must not have ledger entries on or after that date.  
* If the **Check G/L Account Usage** field in the **General Ledger Setup** window is selected, then the account must not be used in any posting groups or posting setup.  

[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] will prevent you from deleting a general ledger account that stores data that is needed in the chart of accounts.
