# <a name="payment-practices-report"></a>Payment practices report

Some countries/regions require that companies report payment times for their vendors as defined by local authorities. This reporting can be based on different sources and can sort vendors based on their size or defined payment terms, providing reporting for vendors for the following as required by local authorities:  

- The average agreed payment period.  
- The average actual payment term.   
- The proportion of invoices paid after the end of the agreed payment period. 

Users can select the period for which they want to run a calculation and to find details based on a grouping that you choose. For each of these groupings, you can find sourced entries. 

> [!NOTE]
> This reporting is so far required in some countries, but this is a global feature and can be used everywhere. Currently, each year Swedish companies with 250 and more employees must report to the Swedish Companies Registration Office what payment times they have for purchases from companies that are smaller than themselves. Similar acts exist in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.
