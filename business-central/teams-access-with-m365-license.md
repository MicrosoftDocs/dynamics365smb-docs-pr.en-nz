# Access Data in Teams without Business Central Licence

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are assigned a Dynamics 365 Business Central licence that allows them to view, modify, and act on their business data within Teams. These users can collaborate on data by sharing records into chats or channels, or adding tabs that show records. However, there may be other employees across the organisation who don't have a Business Central licence but could benefit by being able to view data in Teams. For these users, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers limited access through their Microsoft 365 licences only.  

As an administrator, you can configure environments to enable access with Microsoft 365 licences. You can then choose exactly which tables and other objects this category of user will have access to. Once configured, employees who have a Microsoft 365 licence, but no Business Central licence, can view Business Central records that are shared with them in Microsoft Teams chat and channels.
