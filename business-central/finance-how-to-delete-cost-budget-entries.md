# <a name="delete-cost-budget-entries"></a>Delete Cost Budget Entries
You use the **Delete Cost Budget Entries** batch job to cancel cost budget entries from the cost budget register.  

To prevent any gaps in the cost budget entries and cost register entries, you cannot delete a single entry or a batch of entries in the middle of the list of register entries.  

### <a name="to-delete-a-cost-budget-entry"></a>To delete a cost budget entry  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Cost Budget Entries**, and then choose the related link.  

    The **To Register No.** field contains the last register entry number and cannot be changed.  

    You can use the **From Register No.** field to select a register entry number from which the deletion should begin.  
2.  Choose the **OK** button to delete the selected cost budget entries.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  To avoid an accidental deletion of cost budget entries, you can close register entries by marking the lines as **Closed** in the **Closed** field on the **Cost Budget Registers** page.
