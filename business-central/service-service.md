Providing ongoing service to customers is an important part of any business and one that can be a source of customer satisfaction and loyalty, in addition to revenue. However,managing and tracking service is not always easy, and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] provides a set of tools to help. These tools are designed to support repair shop and field service operations, and can be used in business scenarios such as complex customer service distribution systems, industrial service environments with bills of materials, and high volume dispatching of service technicians with requirements for spare parts management.  

 With these tools you can accomplish the following:  

* Schedule service calls and set up service orders.  
* Track repair parts and supplies.  
* Assign service personnel based on skill and availability.  
* Provide service estimates and service invoices.  

In addition, you can standardise coding, set up contracts, implement a discounting policy, and create route maps for service employees.  

In general, there are two aspects to service management: configuring and setting up your system, and using it for pricing, contracts, orders, service personnel dispatch, and job scheduler.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
