Providing ongoing service to customers is an important part of any business and one that can be a source of customer satisfaction and loyalty, in addition to revenue. However, managing and tracking service isn't always easy, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a set of tools to help. These tools are designed to support repair shops and field service operations, and support typical scenarios for those businesses:

* Schedule service calls.
* Manage service orders.  
* Track repair parts and supplies.  
* Assign service personnel based on skill and availability.  
* Provide service estimates and service invoices.  

In addition, you can standardise coding, set up contracts, implement a discounting policy, and create route maps for service employees.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.
