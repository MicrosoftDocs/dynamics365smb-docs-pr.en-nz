# <a name="automatic-transfer-and-combined-entries"></a>Automatic Transfer and Combined Entries
In cost accounting, you can transfer general ledger entries to a cost type by using a combined posting. You can specify if a cost type receives combined entries in the **Combine Entries** field in the cost type definition. The following table describes the different options.  

|Combine entries|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|None|Each general ledger entry is transferred individually to the corresponding cost type.|  
|Day|General ledger entries with the same posting date are transferred as one entry to the corresponding cost type.|  
|Month|All general ledger entries in the same calendar month are transferred as one entry to the corresponding cost type.|  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you have selected the **Auto Transfer from G/L** check box on the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] updates the cost accounting after every posting in the general ledger. Combined entries are not possible.
