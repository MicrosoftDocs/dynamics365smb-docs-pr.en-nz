# <a name="set-up-sepa-credit-transfer"></a>Set Up SEPA Credit Transfer
From the **Payment Journal** window, you can export payments to a file for upload to your electronic bank for processing of the related money transfers. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] supports the SEPA Credit Transfer format, but in your country/region, other formats for electronic payments may be available.  

To enable export of a bank file formats that are not supported out of the box in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] , you can set up a data exchange definition by using the data exchange framework.

* Set up vendor cards to process payments by exporting files in the SEPA Credit Transfer format  
* Set up the related general journal batch to enable payment export from the **Payment Journal** window  
* Connect the data exchange definition for one or more payment types with the relevant payment method or methods
