[!INCLUDE[ai-preview](includes/ai-preview.md)]

You can try AI-powered item marketing text with Copilot whether you're an existing Business Central customer or a potential customer, that is, someone who's just interested in exploring Business Central and trying out the new capability. To get started, you'll need access to a Business Central online version that supports the new capability. Complete the section below that applies to you.

## <a name="your-organization-already-uses-business-central" />Your organisation already uses Business Central

As an existing customer or partner, you'll need an admin with access to the Business Central admin centre to set up an environment that runs the preview version that includes Copilot. Once the environment is up and running, users can try out the new feature.

If you're an environment admin, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the Business Central admin centre.
2. Select **Environments** > **New**.
3. In the **Create Environment** pane, specify a name for the new environment in the **Environment Name** field.
4. Set **Environment Type** to **Sandbox** or **Production**.
5. Set **Country** to any country/region on the list, but be aware that in the preview, the AI-generated marketing text from Copilot is only in English.
6. In the **Version** box, choose a version 22 or later from the list.

   <!--
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You must use **22.0.54157.54311 (Preview - Copilot edition)** to experience Copilot.
   -->
7. Select **Create**.  

For more information about how to create environments, go to [Create an environment](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments#create-a-new-environment).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have preview sandboxes that run on **22.0.54157.54311 (Preview - Copilot edition)**, be aware that these environments are only available until 01 May 2023. After this date, you'll need to provision a new environment or upgrade any of your other environments to version 22.0 or later to continue trying the preview of AI-powered item marketing text.

## <a name="next-steps" />Next steps

The AI capabilities provided by Copilot must be enabled before you or anyone else can use Copilot. To enable the AI capabilities, an administrator must consent to the terms and conditions of the [preview](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/legaldocs/supp-dynamics365-preview/) and [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839) on behalf of the organisation.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using a trial, you're the administrator. If you've invited other people in your organisation to the trial during sign-up, they won't be able to use Copilot until you agree to the terms and conditions.

There are two ways to consent as an admin:

- The easiest way is to use Copilot. The first time you use Copilot as an admin, you're prompted to review the terms and conditions, then agree or disagree. To learn how to use Copilot, go to [Add marketing text to items](item-marketing-text.md).  

- The other way is to use the **Privacy Notices Status** page in Business Central and agree to the **Azure OpenAI** integration for all users. To learn more, go to [Consent to terms and conditions](enable-ai.md#consent-to-or-reject-the-preview-and-privacy-terms-and-conditions-for-all-users).
