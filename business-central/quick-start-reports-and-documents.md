Reports organise information from different sources in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and present it in a readable way that can be easily printed or digitally shared. Reports can be found on the pages they're contextually associated with. For example, the **Items** page lists reports related to inventory levels, purchases, sales, and more.

1. Open the page associated with the requested report, such as the **Items** page.
2. Choose the **Inventory - Top 10 List** report on the **Reports** menu.
3. On the report request page, set filters to narrow down the date range or change the reference unit of measure used in the report.
4. Choose the **Print** action and follow the device's printing steps.
    1. Alternatively, select the **Preview** action to display the report on the screen.

### <a name="change-report-and-document-layouts" />Change report and document layouts

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] comes with many built-in layouts for your reports and other generated documents, such as sales invoices. You can use applications like Microsoft Word or Excel to edit the layout templates for documents and reports, as described in the following example:

3. Open the layout file in Microsoft Word and edit the document, for example, by moving the date field (*DocumentDate*) or your logo, or by changing font sizes, then save the file.
4. Back on the **Report Layouts** page, choose the **New Layout** action.
5. On the **Add New Layout for a Report** page, enter a name and description on the **Layout Name** and **Description** fields, respectively, to make the layout easy to find.
