# <a name="suggest-vendor-payments"></a>Suggest Vendor Payments
On the **Payment Journal** page, you can use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job to suggest payment lines. Lines for payments that are due soon or payments where a payment discount is available are suggested based on your settings.

To benefit fully from payment suggestions, you must first prioritise your vendors. For more information, see [Prioritise Vendors](purchasing-how-prioritize-vendors.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Vendor ledger entries that are **On Hold** are not included in the batch job.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   If you want to take advantage of payment discounts, and have entered an available amount, the amount will be used for:  
    * Prioritised overdue vendor entries first in order of priority.   
    * Overdue vendor entries that are not prioritised.  
    * Open vendor entries that qualify for payment discounts, arranged by vendor number.  

## <a name="to-use-the-suggest-vendor-payments-function"></a>To use the Suggest Vendor Payments function
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant journal, and then choose the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

## <a name="to-insert-the-due-date-as-posting-date-on-payment-journal-lines"></a>To insert the due date as posting date on payment journal lines
When you use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job to create payment lines for your vendors, you can fill two special fields to make sure that the generated lines use the due date to calculate the posting date. These fields are **Calculate Posting Date from Applies-to-Doc Due Date** and **Applies-to-Doc Due Date Offset**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   You cannot use the **Calculate Posting Date from Applies-to-Doc Due Date** field together with the **Find Payment Discounts** field or the **Summarise per Vendor** field. If the posting date is based on the due date, some payment discounts may not calculate correctly because the posting date is after the payment discount date.  

Also, if the calculated posting date is in the past, then the posting date is moved up to the work date, and a warning is displayed.  

Alternatively, you can manually create payment lines using the due date to calculate the posting date. After you apply vendor ledger entries, you can use the **Calculate Posting Date** action to update the posting date on the journal line with the due date of the related purchase invoice. For more information, see [Apply Purchase Transactions Manually](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>   If the purchase invoice is overdue, the posting date is set to the work date, and the font on the line becomes red.
