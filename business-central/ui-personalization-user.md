# Personalise Your Workspace

You can personalise your workspace to suit your work and preferences. Change pages so that they display only the information you need, where you need it. Personalisation affects only your workspace. It doesn't change how others work.

You can personalise all types of pages, including the Role Centre page. To learn more about Role Centres, go to [Role Centre](ui-change-basic-settings.md#role-center).  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

You can make various changes, such as move or hide fields, columns, actions, and entire parts, and add new fields. Most personalisation must be done by first activating the **Personalising** banner. You can make simple adjustments, such as the column width, immediately on any list.

> [!NOTE]
> Administrators can make the same layout changes as users by customising the workspace for a profile that multiple users are assigned. To learn more about pages for Roles, go to [Customise Pages for Roles](ui-personalization-manage.md)<br /><br />
Administrators can also override or disable users' personalisation, and they can define which features are even available for users to see in all or specific companies. For more information, see [Customising Business Central](ui-customizing-overview.md).

## Video

The following video shows some of the ways in which you can personalise your Role Centre.

## To change the width of a column

You can easily resize columns on any list. Just drag the boundary between two columns to the left or the right.  

1. In the header of a list, select and drag the boundary between two columns.
2. Alternatively, double-click the boundary between two columns to auto-fit the width of the column. The width adjusts to the optimal size for readability.

As for other personalisation, the changes you make to column width are stored on your account and follow you no matter which device you sign into.

## To start personalising a page through the **Personalising** banner

1. Open any page that you want to personalise.
2. In the upper-right corner, select the ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role centre") icon, and then choose the **Personalise** action.

    The **Personalising** banner appears at the top to indicate that you can start making changes.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To navigate during personalisation, use Ctrl + Click on an action if it is highlighted by the arrowhead.

    If you see a ![Personalise Lock](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalise lock") or ![Personalisation blocked](media/personalization-blocked-icon.png "Personalisation blocked") on the banner, you can't personalise the page. For more information, see [Why a Page is Locked from Personalisation](ui-personalization-locked.md).

3. To add a field, choose the **+ Field** action.
4. From the **Add Field to Page** pane, drag and drop a field into the desired position on the page.
5. To change a UI element, point to the element, such as an action, a field, or a part. The element is immediately highlighted with an arrowhead or border.
6. Choose the element, and then choose either **Move**, **Remove**, **Hide**, **Show**, **Show under "Show more"**, **Show when collapsed**, **Show always**, **Set/Clear Freeze Pane**, or **Include/Exclude from Quick Entry**, depending on the type and state of the UI element. For more information, see [What You Can Personalise](#What).
7. When you have finished changing the layout of one or more pages, choose the **Done** button on the **Personalising** banner.

## <a name="Actions"></a>Personalising the action bar and menus

Personalisation lets you decide which actions to show on the navigation and action bars and on Role Centres, and where to show them. You can show, hide, or move individual actions or action groups.

The following video shows how you can personalise actions on pages and Role Centres.

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RE594m2]

Personalising the navigation and action bars is done basically the same way as with other UI elements. However, what you can do with an action or group depends on where the action or group is located. The best way to find out is to enter personalising mode and then let the arrowheads guide you.

There are a couple terms that you should be familiar with to better understand action personalisation: *action group* and *promoted category*.  

An *action group* is an element that expands to display other actions or groups. For example, on the **Sales Orders** page, one action group is the **Functions** action that appears when you choose the **Actions** action.

A *promoted category* is an action group that appears before the vertical line `|` on the action bar. The categories typically include the most commonly used actions, so that you can quickly find them. For example, on the **Sales Orders** page, the **Order**, **Release**, and  **Posting** actions are promoted categories.

> [!NOTE]  
> To clear personalisation, select the arrowhead around the part's designer menu, and then choose **Clear personalisation**.

### To remove, hide, and show actions and action groups

When you want to show or hide an action, the options under the arrowhead define what can do depending on the action's state. 

1. Choose the arrowhead for an action or action group.
2. Choose from one of the following options:

|Option|What it does|
|------|------------
|**Remove**|This option appears if the selected action is also shown somewhere else on the navigation bar or action bar. Choosing this option deletes the action from the selected location so that it no longer appears. The action or action group will remain in the other locations. |
|**Hide**|This option appears if the action or action group isn't located anywhere else on the navigation bar or action bar. Like **Remove**, choosing this option will make the action or action group disappear from the navigation bar or action bar. However, in personalising mode, the action or action group will still be shown in the current position, except that it appears dimmed.|
|**Show**|This option appears if the action or action group has been previously hidden (dimmed). Choosing this option will make the action or action group appear on the navigation bar or action bar.|

### To move actions and action groups

Where you can drop actions or actions groups is indicated by a horizontal line between two actions or a border around an action group. The following limitations exist:

- You can move individual actions into the promoted categories, but you can't rearrange the order of the actions in the category.
- You can't move an action group into a promoted category.

1. To move an action or action group, drag and drop it to the desired position, like you do with fields and columns.
2. To move an action or action group into another action group that is empty, drag the action or action group to the new group and drop it in the **Drop an action here** box.

## <a name="Parts"></a>Personalising parts

Parts are areas on a page that are typically composed of multiple fields, charts or other content. A part shows a coloured border when you focus on the part. For example, a Role Centre home screen has multiple parts. Because of their well-defined boundary, you can personalise the entire part and its contents.

- To move a part, drag and drop it to the desired position. A coloured line indicates valid positions on the screen. For example, FactBoxes can only be moved next to other FactBoxes in the FactBox pane.
- You can hide a part by choosing the **Hide** option under the arrowhead.
- When you start personalising or navigate to a new page, any parts that are currently hidden will appear on the page with distinctive visuals to indicate they are hidden. You can unhide that part by choosing the **Show** option under the arrowhead.

You can clear all personalisation changes that you have made within a single part by choosing the **Clear personalisation** option under the part's arrowhead. Clearing personalisation of a part only affects changes to the contents of the part, not the placement or visibility of the part on the page.  

## To clear personalisation

At some point, you might want to undo some or all of the personalisation changes that you have made to a page over time.

1. On the **Personalising** banner, choose the **Clear personalisation** action.
2. Choose one of the following options.  

> [!CAUTION]
> Clearing personalisation can't be undone.

|Option|What it does|
|------|------------
|**Only Navigation Menu**|Clears any personalisation changes that you have ever made to the navigation menu that is shared across the Role Centre and other pages. Such changes include any new actions that were added as bookmarks, and any changes to links and groups in the menu.|  
|**Only Actions**|Clears any personalisation changes that you have ever made on the navigation or action bars on the page.|
|**Only Fields and Columns**|Clears any personalisation changes that you have ever made to the page except changes on the navigation or action bar. Such changes include changes to fields, columns, parts, and tiles. |
|**All**|Clears all personalisation changes that you have made to the page so it looks like it did originally. Such changes include changes to navigation and action bars, fields, columns, parts, and tiles.|

## Other points of interest

To help you better understand personalisation, here are some pointers.

- When you make changes to a card page that you open from a list, the changes will take effect on all records that you open from that list. For example, let's say you open a specific customer from the Customers list page, and then personalise the page by adding a field. When you open other customers from the list, the field that you added will also be shown.
- Changes that you make will take effect on all your Role Centres. For example, if you make a change to the Customer list when the Role Centre is set to Business Manager, you will also see the change on the **Customers** page when the Role Centre is set to Sales Order Processor.
- Changes to a page in a pane will take effect on the page where ever it's shown.  
- You can only add fields and columns from a predefined list, which is based on the page. You can't create new ones.
- The **Power Automate** item in action bar
  - You can't hide or move the **Automate** item or the **Power Automate** sub-item and its actions **Create a flow** and **Manage Flows**.
  - You can move flows included under the **Automate** item, but you can't hide them using personalisation. Moving the flow makes a copy the flow to the destination, it won't remove it from the **Automate** item.

   > [!TIP]
   > As an administrator, you can hide the **Automation** item from users. Learn more at [Set Up Power Automate Integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-setup).
