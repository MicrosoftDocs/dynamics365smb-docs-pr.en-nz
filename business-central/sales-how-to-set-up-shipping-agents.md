You can set up a code for each of your shipping agents and enter information about them.  

If you enter an Internet address for the shipping agent, and the agent provides package tracking services on the Internet, you can use the automatic package tracking feature. For more information, see [Track Packages](sales-how-track-packages.md).

When you set up shipping agents on your sales orders, you can also specify the services that each shipping agent offers.  
For each shipping agent, you can set up an unlimited number of services, and you can specify a shipping time for each service.  

When you have assigned a shipping agent service to a sales order line, the shipping time of the service will be included in the order promising calculation, for that line. For more information, see [Calculate Order Promising Dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md).
