This application provides a dashboard with summary data for each company that the user has access to across all [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, such as the many clients of an accountant. The home page displays financial KPIs as well as a direct link to the individual environments and companies so that users can.

The dashboard is a highly specialised Role Centre for a better overview of your work.

When you first install the extension, a sample company helps you get started. You can delete the sample company at any time.
