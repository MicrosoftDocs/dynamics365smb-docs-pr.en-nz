<!--
- People You and your coworkers have the following permissions in [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]
  - To paste a [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] link into a Teams conversation and have it expand into a card, you have to have at least permission to view the page and its data.
  - Once a card is submitted into a conversation, any user in that conversation can view that card without having permission to Business Central.
  - For other users to view more details from card, they must also have view permission, as a minimum, to the page and its data. If they want to change data, they'll need modify permissions.

  Setting up permissions is typically done by an administrator. For more information, see [Managing Microsoft Teams Integration](admin-teams-integration.md).-->
