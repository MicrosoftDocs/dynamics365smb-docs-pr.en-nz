# Put away production or assembly output

How you put away your output from production depends on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

In a basic warehouse configuration for the inbound flow (put-away), on the **Location Card** page for the location, activate following settings:

* For production, in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Put-away**.
* Assembly processes don't support inventory put-aways. You post an assembly order to register output. If you use bins, you can move items between the bins later. Learn more at [Move Items Ad Hoc in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md).  
* For projects, put-away isn't applicable.

In advanced warehouse configurations where a location requires put-away, create an internal put-away document or a movement document to put away the output.  

## To put away production output with an inventory put-away

The first step to put away output is to create the inbound warehouse request. This request informs the warehouse that the production or assembly order output is ready to be put away.

### To create the inbound warehouse request  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Released Production Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the production order that's ready for put-away, and then choose the **Create Inbound Whse. Request** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also create the inbound warehouse request by choosing the **Create Inbound Request** field when you refresh the production order. Learn more at [Refresh or Replan Production Orders](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md).  

### To put away output with an inventory put-away  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-away**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new inventory put-away. Learn more at [Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-inventory-put-aways.md).
3. To access the production order output, choose the **Get Source Documents** action, and then select the released production order.  
4. Fill in the put-away lines as needed.
5. When the lines are ready for posting, choose the **Post** action. Posting creates the warehouse entries and posts the output of the items.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-warehouse](includes/preview-posting-warehouse.md)]

You can also create an **Inventory Put-away** directly from the released production order. Learn more at [Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-inventory-put-aways.md).  

When you post an inventory put-away, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assumes that all the operations are posted according to the standard routing. That is, the output quantity is posted according to the last operation. You can use the output journal to post variances in the output quantity and the setup and run times. If you must post partially after you created the inventory put-away, you can do so on set-up times and quantities for all operations except the last one. The inventory put-away controls the last operation.  

If you only need to post the set-up or run time on the last operation, set the output quantity on the last operation to 0. You can choose not to post the last line at all by deleting it.

## To put away assembly and production output in advanced warehouse configurations

When you post production or assembly order output in a warehouse that uses directed put-away and pick, the output goes to the bin defined in the production or assembly order. To learn more about different ways to move items in the warehouse with advanced configurations, go to [Move Items in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-in-advanced-warehousing.md#to-move-items-with-the-warehouse-movement-worksheet).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't enter the source document number, such as the production order number, in the internal put-away, put-away, or movement documents for assembly or production output processes.
