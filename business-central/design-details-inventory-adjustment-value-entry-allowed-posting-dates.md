# Error message: "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting datesâ€¦"

When you use the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, you might run into the following error message:

**Posting date is not within your range of allowed posting dates**

This message indicates that you aren't allowed to post entries for the date you entered. You can get around this issue by changing your user setup.

## Change the user setup  

|User ID  |Allow Posting From  | Allow Posting To  |
|---------|---------|--------|
|EUROPE  |  2020-09-11      |2020-09-30      |

In this case, you're allowed to post in the date range from September 11 to September 30. However, you aren't allowed to post the adjustment value entry with a September 10 posting date.
