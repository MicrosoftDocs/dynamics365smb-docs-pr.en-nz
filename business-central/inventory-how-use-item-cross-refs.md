# <a name="use-item-references"></a>Use Item References
If you set up a reference between the item description that you use for an item and the description that the vendor of that item uses, then the vendor's item description is automatically inserted on purchase documents for the vendor when you fill in the **Item Reference No.** field. The same functionality applies for customer item numbers on sales documents.

The following procedures describe how to use item references on the purchase side. The steps are similar for the sales side.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all companies use item references, so to minimise clutter on pages we've hidden the related fields and actions. If you decide to use them, you can turn on the **Use Item References** toggle on the **Inventory Setup** page. After you enable item references, the fields and actions are available on the Item Card, Vendor Card, and Customer Card pages, and from sales and purchase documents.

## <a name="to-start-using-item-references"></a>To start using item references
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Turn on the **Use Item References** toggle.

## <a name="to-set-up-an-item-reference-to-a-vendors-item-description"></a>To set up an item reference to a vendor's item description

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for an item for which you want to create a reference to the item description that the vendor uses for that item.
3. Choose the **Item References** action.

     If you cannot find the **Item References** action, choose to view more options, and then find it under **Related** > **Item**.
  
4. On a new line on the **Item Reference Entries** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

## <a name="to-enter-a-vendors-item-description-on-a-purchase-order"></a>To enter a vendor's item description on a purchase order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a purchase order for the vendor that you set up an item reference for in the previous procedure.
3. Create a purchase line for the item that you set up an item reference for in the previous procedure.
4. In the **Item Reference No.** field, select the item reference that you have created, and then choose the **OK** button.

The **Description** field on the line is overwritten with the vendor's item description, as set up on the item reference entry.
