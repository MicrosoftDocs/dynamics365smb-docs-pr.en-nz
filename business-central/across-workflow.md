You can set up and use workflows that connect business-process tasks performed by different users. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in workflows, preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps.  

 On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines from fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios that are supported by the application code.  

 The generic version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] includes a number of preconfigured workflows represented by workflow templates that you can copy to create workflows. The code for workflow templates that are added by Microsoft are prefixed with “MS-“. For more information, see the list of workflow templates in the Workflow Templates page.  

 If a business scenario requires a workflow event or response that is not supported, you can either use Power Automate or work with a Microsoft partner to customise the application code. For more information, see [Using [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] in an Automated Workflow](across-how-use-financials-data-source-flow.md).

Any workflow template that you create with Power Automate is added to the list of workflow templates within [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. For more information, see [Using Business Central in an Automated Workflow](across-how-use-financials-data-source-flow.md).  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
