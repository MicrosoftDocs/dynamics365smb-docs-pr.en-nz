# <a name="register-new-customers"></a>Register New Customers
Customers are the source of your income. You must register each customer you sell to as a customer card. Customer cards hold the information that is required to sell products to the customer. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) and [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

Before you can register new customers, you must set up various sales codes that you can select from when you fill in customer cards. For more information, see [Setting Up Sales](sales-setup-sales.md).

> [!NOTE]  
>   If customer templates exist for different customer types, then a page appears when you create a new customer card from where you can select an appropriate template. If only one customer template exists, then new customer cards always use that template.

## <a name="to-create-a-new-customer-card"></a>To create a new customer card
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Customers** page, choose the **New** action.

    If only one customer template exists, then a new customer card opens with some fields filled with information from the template.

    If more than one customer template exists, then a page opens from which you can select a customer template. In that case, follow the next two steps.
3. On the **Select a template for a new customer** page, choose the template that you want to use for the new customer card.
4. Choose the **OK** button. A new customer card opens with some fields filled with information from the template.  
5. Proceed to fill or change fields on the customer card as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

On the **Sales Prices** FastTab, you can view special prices or discounts that you grant for the customer if certain criteria are met, such as item, minimum order quantity, or ending date. Each row represents a special price or line discount. Each column represents a criterion that must apply to warrant the special price that you enter in the **Unit Price** field, or the line discount that you enter in the **Line Discount %** field. For more information, see [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

The customer is now registered, and the customer card is ready to be used on sales documents.

If you want to use this customer card as a template when you create new customer cards, you can save it as a template. For more information, see the following section.

## <a name="to-save-the-customer-card-as-a-template"></a>To save the customer card as a template
1. On the **Customer Card** page, choose the **Save as Template** action. The **Customer Template** page opens showing the customer card as a template.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To reuse dimensions in templates, choose the **Dimensions** action. The **Dimension Templates** page opens showing any dimension codes that are set up for the customer.
4. Edit or enter dimension codes that will apply to new customer cards created by using the template.  
5. When you have completed the new customer template, choose the **OK** button.

The customer template is added to the list of customer templates, so that you can use it to create new customer cards.
