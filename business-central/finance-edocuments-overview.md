# <a name="e-documents-overview"></a>E-Documents overview

Electronic documents (e-documents) are the backbone of modern business transactions. They encompass vital documents, such as invoices and receipts in both directions (delivery and receipt). They also add capabilities for document statusâ€“related messaging between access points.

Our commitment to enhancing your business processes led to the development of a groundbreaking app that's dedicated to e-documents in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. This app serves as a robust platform for efficient e-document management.

> [!NOTE]
> To use these capabilities, install the E-Document Core app in your environment.

The E-Document app can be used in countries/regions where companies require specialised e-document handling to comply with local regulations. The app provides a solid foundation that can be easily extended to meet specific local or industry requirements.

The documentation explains e-documents in detail. It shows the capabilities of the app and demonstrates how it seamlessly adapts to cater to your organisation's unique needs. To get started with e-documents, see the following articles.
