# <a name="set-up-sepa-direct-debit"></a>Set Up SEPA Direct Debit
From the **Direct Debit Collections** page, you can export instructions to your electronic bank to perform a direct debit collection from the customer’s bank account to your bank account. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] supports the SEPA direct debit format, but in your country/region, other formats for electronic payments may be available.  

To enable export of a bank file formats that are not supported out of the box in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] , you can set up a data exchange definition by using the data exchange framework.

* Set up the export format of the bank file that instructs your bank to perform a direct debit collection from the customer’s bank account to your bank account.  
* Set up the customer’s payment method.
