# <a name="set-up-sepa-direct-debit"></a>Set Up SEPA Direct Debit
From the **Direct Debit Collections** window, you can export instructions to your electronic bank to perform a direct debit collection from the customer’s bank account to your bank account. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] supports the SEPA direct debit format, but in your country/region, other formats for electronic payments may be available.  

To enable export of a bank file formats that are not supported out of the box in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] , you can set up a data exchange definition by using the data exchange framework.

Before you can process customer payments electronically by exporting direct debit instructions in the SEPA Direct Debit format, you must perform the following setup steps:  

* Set up the export format of the bank file that instructs your bank to perform a direct debit collection from the customer’s bank account to your bank account.  
* Set up the customer’s payment method.  
* Set up the direct-debit mandate that reflects your agreement with the customer to collect their payments in a certain agreement period.
