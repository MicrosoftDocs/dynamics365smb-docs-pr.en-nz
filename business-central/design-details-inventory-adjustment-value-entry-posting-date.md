# <a name="design-details-posting-date-on-adjustment-value-entry"></a>Design Details: Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry  

This article provides guidance for users of the Inventory Costing functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The specific article is providing guidance in how the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job identifies and assigns a posting date to the value entries that the batch job is about to create.  

First the concept of the process is reviewed, how the batch job identifies and assigns the Posting Date to the Value Entry to be created. Thereafter there are some scenarios shared that we in the support team come across from time to time and finally there is a summary of the concepts used.  

## <a name="the-concept"></a>The Concept  

The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job assigns a posting date to the value entry it is about to create in the following steps:  

1.  Initially the Posting Date of the entry to be created is the same date as the entry it adjusts.  

2.  The Posting Date is validated against Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

3.  Assignment of Posting Date; If the initial Posting Date is not within allowed posting date range the batch job will assign an allowed Posting Date from either General Ledger Setup or Inventory Period. If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in General Ledger Setup are defined, the later date of the two will be assigned to the Adjustment Value Entry.  

 Let’s review this process more in practice. Assume we have an Item Ledger Entry of Sale. The item was shipped on September 5, 2020 and it was invoiced the day after.  


**Item Ledger Entry**  
Date format YYYY-MM-DD

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Entry Type  | Document No. |Location Code  |Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Invoiced Quantity  |Remaining Quantity  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|319     |A         |2020-09-05     |  Sale       |102033     |  Blue       | -1    |    -11     |-1     |    0     |

Below, the first Value Entry (379) represents the shipment and carry the same Posting Date as the parent Item ledger Entry.  
  
The second Value Entry (381) represents the invoice.  

The third Value Entry (391) is an Adjustment of the invoicing Value Entry (381).  
  

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Location Code  |Item Ledger Entry Quantity  |Invoiced Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Amount (Expected)  |Adjustment  |Applies-to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|379     |  A       |    2020-09-05     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 102033        |319     | Blue        | -1       |0         |  0       |     -10   |No   |0    |Sales          |
|381     |  A       |    2020-09-06     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |-1        |-10       |    10     | No  |0      |       Sales   |
|391     |  A       |    2020-09-10     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |0         |-1        |    0     |Yes   |    181   | INVTADJMT   |

Posting Date on Adjustment entry is initially set to the same Posting date of the entry it adjusts.

 Step 1: Adjustment Value Entry to be created is assigned same Posting Date as the entry it adjusts, illustrated above by Value entry 391.  
  
 Step 2: Validation of initial assigned Posting Date.  

The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job determines if the initial Posting Date of the Adjustment Value Entry is within allowed posting date range based upon Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

Let’s review the above mentioned Sale by adding setup of allowed posting date ranges.  
  
**Inventory Periods**

|Ending Date  |Name  |Closed  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|2020-01-31     |January 2020      |  Yes    |
|2020-02-28     |February 2020     |  Yes    |
|2020-03-31     |March 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-04-30     |April 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-05-31     |May   2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-06-30     |June   2020       |  Yes    |
|2020-07-31     |July  2020        |   Yes   |
|2020-08-31     |August   2020     |   Yes   |
|2020-09-30     |September   2020  |         |
|2020-10-31     |October   2020    |         |
|2020-11-30     |November   2020   |         |
|2020-12-31     |December   2020   |         |

First allowed posting date is the first day in the first open period. September 1, 2020.  

**General Ledger Setup**

|Field|Value  |
|---------|---------|
|Allow Posting From:  |  2020-09-10      |
|Allow Posting To:    |  2020-09-30      |
|Register Time:       |         |
|Local Address Format:|   Post Code      |  

 First allowed posting date is the date stated in field Allow Posting From: September 1, 2020.  
 If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in General Ledger Setup are defined, the later date of the two will define the allowed posting date range.  

 Step 3: Assignment of an allowed posting date;  

 The initial assigned Posting Date was September 6 as illustrated in step 1. However, in the second step the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job identifies that earliest allowed Posting Date is September 10 and thereby assigns September 10 to the Adjustment Value Entry, below.  

   
|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Location Code  |Item Ledger Entry Quantity  |Invoiced Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Amount (Expected)  |Adjustment  |Applies-to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|379     |  A       |    2020-09-05     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 102033        |319     | Blue        | -1       |0         |  0       |     -10   |No   |0    |Sales          |
|381     |  A       |    2020-09-06     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |-1        |-10       |    10     | No  |0      |       Sales   |
|391     |  A       |    **2020-09-10**     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |0         |-1        |    0     |Yes   |    181   | INVTADJMT   |

 We have now reviewed the concept for assigning Posting Dates to Value Entries created by the Adjust Cost - Item entries batch job.  

 Let’s continue to review some scenarios that we in the support team comes across from time to time in relation to assigned Posting Dates in the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job and related setups.  

## <a name="scenario-i-posting-date-is-not-within-your-range-of-allowed-posting-dates"></a>Scenario I: “Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates…”  

 This is a scenario where a user is experiencing mentioned error message when the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job is run.  

 In the previous section, describing the concept of assigning posting dates, the intention of the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job is to create a Value Entry with Posting Date September 10th.  

![Error message about posting date.](media/helene/TechArticleAdjustcost6.png "Error message about posting date")

 We follow up on the User Setup:  

**User Setup**  

Sorting: User ID  

|User ID  |Allow Posting From  | Allow Posting To  |
|---------|---------|--------|
|EUROPE  |  2020-09-11      |2020-09-30      |

 The user in this case has an allowed posting date range from September 11 to September 30 and is thereby not allowed to post the Adjustment Value Entry with Posting Date September 10th.

 Assigning the user a wider (or same) allowed posting date range as in Inventory Period or General Ledger Setup, mentioned conflict will be avoided. The Adjustment Value Entry with Posting Date September 10th will be posted successfully with this setup.

An older Knowledge Base article [952996](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/information-about-inventory-adjustment-posting-dates-in-microsoft-dynamics-nav-99e22b2b-5b79-a9b2-3b43-7f3484fa31d9) discusses more scenarios related to the mentioned error message.

The Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job has recognised a change in cost and adjusted the Negative Adjustments.  

**Review of Posting Dates on created adjustment value entries:** The earliest allowed Posting Date the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job has to relate to is January 1, 2021 as stated in the General Ledger Setup.  

**Negative Adjustment in step 3:** assigned Posting Date is January 1, provided by General Ledger Setup. The Posting Date of the Value Entry in scope for adjustment is December 20, 2020. According to General Ledger Setup, the date is not within allowed posting date range. Therefore the Posting Date stated in the Allow Posting From field in the General Ledger Setup is assigned to the Adjustment Value Entry.  

**Negative Adjustment in step 4:** assigned Posting Date is January 15. The Value Entry in scope of adjustment has Posting Date January 15, which is within the allowed posting date range according to General Ledger Setup.  

The adjustment made for the Negative Adjustment in step 3 causes discussion. The favorable Posting Date for the Adjustment Value Entry would have been December 20 or at least within December as the revaluation causing the change in COGS was posted in December.  

To achieve adjustment in December of the Negative Adjustment in step 3, the General Ledger Setup, Allow Posting From field, need to state a date in December.  

**Conclusion:**  

With the experiences from this scenario, considering most suitable setup of allowed posting date range for a company, you might want to consider the following information: As long as you allow changes in inventory value to be posted in a period, December in this case, the setup that the company uses for allowed posting date ranges should be aligned with this decision. The Allow Posting From in the General Ledger Setup, stating December 1, would allow the revaluation made in December to be forwarded to affected outbound entries in the same period.  

User groups not allowed to post in December but in January, which was probably intended to be limited by the General Ledger Setup in this scenario, should instead be addressed via the User setup.

Inventory Valuation report is printed as at Date December 31, 2020

![Content of the Inventory Valuation report.](media/helene/TechArticleAdjustcost13.png "Content of the Inventory Valuation report")

 **Summary of scenario:**  

 The described scenario ends up with an Inventory Valuation report demonstrating Quantity = 0 while the Value = 2. The Item charge posted in step 11 is part of the Inventory Increase value of December while the Inventory Decrease of the same period is not affected.  

 Having the General Ledger Setup stating Allow Posting From January 1 was a good thing for the first Item charge. The costs of the Inventory Increase and Decrease was recorded in the same period. For the second Item charge however, the General Ledger Setup causes the change in COGS to be recognised in the period after.  

 **Conclusion:**  

 It’s a challenge to have the Inventory Valuation report to demonstrate Quantity = 0 while the Value <> 0. In this case it’s also more difficult to express the optimal settings, having purchase invoices arriving the same day but addressing different periods or even financial years. Crossing to a new financial year usually requires some planning and as part of that the insight of Adjust Cost – Item entries process, recognising COGS, is to be considered.  

 In this scenario one option could have been to have the General Ledger Setup, field Allow Posting From, stating a date in December for a couple of more days and the posting of the first item charge postponed to allow all costs for the previous period/financial year to be recognised for the period they belong to first, having the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job run and thereafter move the allowed posting date to the new period\/financial year. The first item charge with posting date January 2 could then be posted.  

## <a name="history-of-adjust-cost--item-entries-batch-job"></a>History of Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job  

 Below is a summary of the concept assigning Posting Dates to Adjustment Value Entries by the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job.  

### <a name="about-the-request-form-posting-date"></a>About the request form posting date:  

 There is no longer a posting date to be stated in the request form of the Adjust Cost - Item entries batch job. The batch job runs through all necessary changes and creates value entries with the posting date of the value entry it adjusts. If the posting date is not within allowed posting date range the posting date in the Allow Posting From field in the General Ledger Setup, OR if the Inventory periods are used, the later date of the two will be used. See described concept above.  

## <a name="history-of-post-inventory-cost-to-gl-batch-job"></a>History of Post Inventory cost to G/L batch job  

 The Post Inventory Cost to G/L batch job is closely related to the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job why the history of this batch job is summarised and shared here as well.  
 
![Actual cost versus expected cost.](media/helene/TechArticleAdjustcost14.png "Actual cost versus expected cost")

### <a name="about-the-posting-date"></a>About the posting date  

 There is no longer a posting date to be stated in the request form of the Post Inventory Cost to G/L batch job. The G/L entry is created with the same Posting Date as the related value entry. In order to complete the batch job, the allowed posting date range must allow the Posting Date of the created G/L entry. If not, the allowed posting date range must be temporarily reopened by changing or removing the dates in the Allow Posting From and To fields in the General Ledger Setup. To avoid reconciliation issues, it is required that Posting Date of the G/L Entry corresponds to the Posting Date of the Value Entry.  

 The batch job scans Table 5811 - Post Value Entry to G/L, to identify the Value Entries in scope for posting to General Ledger. After a successful run, the table is emptied.
