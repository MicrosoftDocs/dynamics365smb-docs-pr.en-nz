COMMENTING THIS OUT BECAUSE i CANNOT REPRODUCE THE SETTINGS. tHERE IS NO CONSOLIDATION CODE FIELD ON DIMENSIONS OR DIMENSIOIN VALUES.

You can consolidate dimension information and general ledger accounts, as follows:

* To exclude dimension information in the consolidation, leave the **Consolidation Code** field blank, and do not choose dimensions in the **Copy Dimensions** fields in any consolidation functions or reports described later in this topic.
* To include dimension information in the consolidation, leave the **Consolidation Code** field blank. However, the consolidation will only work if the dimension values in the business unit are the same as the consolidated company.
* To consolidate the dimension value code in the business unit with a different dimension value code in the consolidated company, fill in the **Consolidation Code**. -->
