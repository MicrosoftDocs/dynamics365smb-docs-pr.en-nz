## Apply saved settings to a report
1. Open the report.

   The report request page appears.    
2. In the **Saved Settings** section of the page, set the **Name** field  to the saved settings that you want to use.

   The **Saved Settings** section only appears if the report has been run before or if there are existing saved settings entries. The saved settings entry called **Last used options and filters** is always available. These settings are the option and filter values that were used the last time you ran the report.
