# <a name="define-check-layouts"></a>Define Cheque Layouts
You can design your cheques to conform with the standards set by the local authorities. Cheque images can be printed in English, French, or Spanish.

Cheques are designed to print in both the United States and Canadian cheque image formats in either a cheque-stub-cheque format or a stub-stub-cheque format.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Selections Bank Account**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Report Selection - Bank Acc.** page, in the **Usage** field, select **Cheque**.
3. Select one of the following report IDs.

| Report ID | Report Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1401 |Cheque |This is the default report. |
