# <a name="select-a-check-layout"></a>Select a Cheque Layout
You can design your cheques to conform with the standards set by the local authorities. Cheque images can be printed in English, French, or Spanish.

Cheques are designed to print in both the United States and Canadian cheque image formats in either a cheque-stub-cheque format or a stub-stub-cheque format.

## <a name="to-select-a-check-layout"></a>To select a cheque layout
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Selections Bank Account**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Report Selection - Bank Acc.** page, in the **Usage** field, select **Cheque**.
3. Select one of the following report IDs.

| Report ID | Report Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1401 |Cheque |This is the default report. |
| 10411 |Cheque (Stub/Stub/Cheque) |This report is designed to print cheques in a stub/stub/cheque format. |
| 10412 |Cheque (Stub/Cheque/Stub) |This report is designed to print cheques in a stub/cheque/stub format. |
| 10413 |Three Cheques per Page |This report is designed to print three cheques on each page. |

When you have set up cheque layouts, you can print cheques from the **Payment Journal** page. For more information, see [Work with Cheques](payables-how-work-checks.md).

To change one of these default cheque layouts, use either the Word or the RDLC integration to do so. For more information, see [Create and Modify a Custom Report or Document Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).
