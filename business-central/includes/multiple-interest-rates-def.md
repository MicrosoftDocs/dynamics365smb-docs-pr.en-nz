For each finance charge term code, you can specify multiple interest rates so that you can calculate finance charges with multiple interest rates for a specific period. This is helpful if you charge different interest on payments that are late. The interest calculation is the same for each financial charge, with variation only in the rate of interest for a specific period. If multiple interest rates are not set up, then the interest rate and period that is defined in the **Finance Charge Terms** and **Reminder Terms** pages for the whole period of calculation will be used.
