If you want to start using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to run your business, you must buy a licence. Your administrator can then assign the licence to users. However, if you want to convert a 30-day trial company into your actual production company, we encourage all uses to sign out of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. Then, once an administrator has assigned the licence to your account, the first user who signs into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] must be a user with this licence assigned. This way, the 30-day trial ends, and any trial-related notifications disappear so that users can use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to do work.
