To submit an EC sales list report, go to the [EC Sales List Reports](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=321) page, and then choose the **New** action. In the **EC Sales List Report** page, specify the period and other required fields. Then choose the **Suggest Lines** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] will check your GST entries to calculate the suggested lines for the report. Once you are ready to submit, you must first release the report, and then submit the report.
