You'll need a URL to make the connection to OneDrive from Business Central. The easiest way to get the URL is to sign in to [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com) for your organisation. In the browser address, you'll see a URL that has the following format:

`https://<your Microsoft 365 tenant name>-my.sharepoint.com/personal/<your user name>`

For example, `https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/rsimone_contoso_onmicrosoft_com`.

You don't need the entire URL. You only use the portion before `/personal`:

`https://<your Microsoft 365 tenant name>-my.sharepoint.com`

For example,  `https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com`.  

There are other ways to get the URL as well. For more information, see [OneDrive URLs for users in your organisation](/onedrive/list-onedrive-urls) in the OneDrive documentation.
