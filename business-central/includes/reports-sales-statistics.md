Shows amounts for sales, profit, invoice discount, and payment discount in LCY, and the profit percentage for each customer. The costs and profits are given as both the original and adjusted amounts. The original costs and profits are those values that were calculated at the time of posting, and the adjusted costs and profits reflect changes to the original costs of the items in the sales. The cost adjustment amount shown in the report is the difference between the original cost and the adjusted cost.<br>The figures are divided into three periods. You can select the length of the period, starting on a selected date. There are also columns for amounts before and after the three periods. Use the report to analyse earnings from an individual customer and earnings trends, for example.
