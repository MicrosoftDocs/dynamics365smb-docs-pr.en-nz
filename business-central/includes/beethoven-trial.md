## <a name="sign-up"></a>Sign-up

### <a name="which-email-address-i-should-use-to-sign-up"></a>Which email address I should use to sign up?

Use your work or school email address. We'll establish your trial on your crganisation’s account. You cannot use email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers, such as outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and others.  

### <a name="what-are-the-system-requirements-for-the-trial"></a>What are the system requirements for the trial?

This app is a cloud-based service that doesn't require special software other than an up-to-date web browser, though some restrictions apply.  

### <a name="how-do-i-sign-up-for-the-trial-without-a-microsoft-365-tenant"></a>How do I sign up for the trial without a Microsoft 365 tenant?

You can't. Use a work or school email address.

### <a name="can-i-sign-up-for-other-dynamics-365-apps-such-as-sales-marketing-and-customer-service"></a>Can I sign up for other Dynamics 365 apps such as Sales, Marketing, and Customer Service?

Yes, you can. To view all available trials, [visit the trial hub page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/dynamics-365-free-trial). You can use the same email account to sign up for different trials.<!-- However, it is not possible to have multiple apps on the same trial site. Each trial will be on a different org and URL. The trial data won’t be shared across apps.-->

### <a name="i-didnt-receive-the-trial-details-email-after-signing-up-what-should-i-do"></a>I didn't receive the trial details email after signing up, what should I do?

When you sign up for the trial, you'll receive an email with the trial details. If you don't see the email in your inbox, check your spam folder. Alternatively, use the following steps to access your app:

1. Go to [the trial site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=847861), choose *Finance and operations*, and then, on the **Dynamics 365 Business Central** card, choose the **Try for free** button.  
2. Enter your work or school email address. You'll be redirected to your trial app.  

### <a name="how-do-i-add-more-users-to-a-trial"></a>How do I add more users to a trial?

To add users, ask your administrator to go to the [Microsoft 365 admin centre](https://admin.microsoft.com) where they can follow the [admin centre guidance](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users) to add users up to the trial licence limit. If the user you are adding already has a Microsoft 365 account, assign them the relevant licence. For more information, see [Assign licences to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users) in the Microsoft 365 content.

### <a name="how-many-users-can-i-add-to-my-trial-environment"></a>How many users can I add to my trial environment?

You can add an unlimited number of users to the trial environment.

### <a name="how-do-i-reset-the-trial-environment"></a>How do I reset the trial environment?

You can't reset the trial environment. But your admin can create fresh sandbox environments where you can play around with the various capabilities. For more information, see [Production and Sandbox Environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/environment-types) in the admin content.  

If you want to cancel [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] during a trial period, you must ask your Microsoft 365 administrator to remove the trial subscription from your company's account in the [Microsoft 365 admin centre](https://admin.microsoft.com/). See also [Unsubscribe or Remove [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)]](../admin-cancel.md).  

If you signed up for Dynamics 365 Business Central using a non-Microsoft 365 business account, you do not have a Microsoft 365 administrator. To unsubscribe, you must contact the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] Cancellation team by sending an email message at [cancelbusinesscentra@microsoft.com](mailto:cancelbusinesscentra@microsoft.com). You must include the name of your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] tenant in the message so that we can identify you. You can find this information in the **Help and Support** page that you can access from the **?** menu. For more information, see [Resources for Help and Support](../product-help-and-support.md).
