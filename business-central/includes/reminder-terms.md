To manage accounts receivables, you can set up reminder terms and assign them to customers. Reminder terms let you control how the reminder process works. Each reminder term has a set of reminder levels that you define. Reminder levels include rules about when the reminder will be issued, what fees to charge, and whether to calculate interest. Reminder levels also include a grace period setting that ensures you don't send a reminder for a bill that a customer already paid.
