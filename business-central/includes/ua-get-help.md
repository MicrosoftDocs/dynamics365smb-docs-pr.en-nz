[!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] includes tooltips for fields and actions that can help guide you through the various business processes. Some pages also have teaching tips and tours to help you. On each tooltip and teaching tip, choose the **Show help** link to open the Help pane where you find information about the current page and related tasks. If the chat with Copilot feature is turned on, instead of the **Show help** link on tooltips, you have an **Ask Copilot** link. When you select this link, the chat pane opens and a prompt asking for an explanation of the field is automatically entered, like "Explain field name "Invoice Discount %". On all pages, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> on your keyboard to open the Help pane. On any device, use the question mark in the upper right corner to get to the Help.
