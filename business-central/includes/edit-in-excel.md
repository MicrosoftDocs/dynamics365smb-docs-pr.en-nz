> [!TIP]
> If you have a lot of lines on a journal or warehouse worksheet, if the **Edit in Excel** action is available on the page it can make it easier to enter data. You can make changes to records in Excel, and then update the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)]. To learn more about the Edit in Excel action, go to [Edit in Excel](../across-work-with-excel.md#edit-in-excel).
