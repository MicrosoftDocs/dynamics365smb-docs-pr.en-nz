The general journal only shows a limited number of fields on the journal line by default. If you want to see additional fields, such as the **Account Type** field, choose the **Show More Columns** action. To hide the additional fields again, choose the **Show Fewer Columns** action. When you see fewer columns, then the same posting date is used for all lines. If you want to have multiple posting dates for the same journal entry, choose the **Show More Columns** action.
