The general journal only shows a limited number of fields in the journal line by default. If you want to see additional fields, such as the **Balancing General Product Posting Group** field, choose the **Page** action in the navigation bar, and then choose **Show more columns**. To hide the additional fields again, choose **Show fewer columns**.
