### Reversing Journals to Correct Mistakes

When working with journals that have many lines and something goes wrong, it's important to have an easy way to correct mistakes. The **Posted General Journal** page offers a couple of actions that can help.

* **Copy Selected Lines to Journal** - Copy only the lines that you select.
* **Copy G/L Register to Journal** - Copy all lines that belong to the same G/L register.

These actions let you create a copy of a general journal line or a batch, and then specify:

* The journal to copy the lines to
* Whether with opposite signs (a reversing journal)
* A different posting date or document number

To allow journals to be copied to posted general journals, on the **General Journal Templates** or **General Journal Batch** pages, choose the **Copy to Posted Jnl. Lines** checkbox. After you allow people to copy posted general journals, if needed you can turn off copying for specific batches.
