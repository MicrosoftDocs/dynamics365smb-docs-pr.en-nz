[!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] online is governed under the [Modern Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/help/30881/modern-lifecycle-policy). The service level agreement terms are described in the document that you can download from the **Service Level Agreements for Microsoft Online Services** section on the [Licensing terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products) page.  

Furthermore, as an administrator, you can monitor your tenant's health and specify upgrade windows in the [Business Central Administration Centre](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center).  

Databases are protected by automatic backups that are retained for 30 days. As an administrator, you cannot access or manage these backups because they are managed automatically by Microsoft. For more information about the underlying technology, see [Automatic backups](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automated-backups).
