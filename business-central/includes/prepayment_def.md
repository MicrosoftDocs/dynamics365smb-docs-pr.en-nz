Prepayments are payments that are invoiced and posted to a sales or purchase order before you post the final invoice. For example, you might require a deposit before you manufacture items to order, or you might require payment before you ship items to a customer. You can use the prepayments capabilities to invoice and collect deposits from customers, and to remit deposits to vendors. This way, all relevant payments are posted against the same invoice.
