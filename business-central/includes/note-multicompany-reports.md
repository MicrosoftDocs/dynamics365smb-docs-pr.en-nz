> It was possible to get the data from various companies in a single report with OData web services. But since [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 2, only ODataV4 is supported, which doesn't export data from multiple companies. The **$expand** function in Power BI that you might think to be an alternative way to create a multi-company report, can't be used either. It will create a column with the company name but won't populate it with the company data after a refresh.
