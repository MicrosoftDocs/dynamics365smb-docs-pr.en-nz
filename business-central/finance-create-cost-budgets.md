# <a name="creating-cost-budgets"></a>Creating Cost Budgets
Budgeting in cost accounting resembles budgeting in the general ledger. A cost budget is created based on cost types just as a budget for the general ledger is created based on general ledger accounts.  

A cost budget is created for a certain period of time, for example, a fiscal year. You can create as many cost budgets as needed. You can create a new cost budget manually, or by importing a cost budget, or by copying an existing cost budget as the budget base. For more information, see [Create G/L Budgets](finance-how-create-budgets.md).

You use the following windows to create and analyse cost budgets. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon to find a window, and then read the tooltip for each.
