title: How to Correct Prepayments | Microsoft Docs
description: You can make a correction to an order after you have posted a prepayment invoice for the order. You can add new lines to an order after issuing a prepayment, and then you can post another prepayment invoice, but you cannot delete a line from an order after a prepayment has been invoiced for the line.
