# <a name="transfer-inventory-between-locations"></a>Transfer Inventory Between Locations

You can transfer inventory items between locations by creating transfer orders. Alternatively, you can use the item reclassification journal.

> [!NOTE]
> To transfer items, you must set up locations and transfer routes. To learn more about setting up locations, go to [Set Up Locations](inventory-how-setup-locations.md). You can't use transfer orders for *blank* locations.

## <a name="transfer-orders"></a>Transfer orders

You can ship an outbound transfer from one location and receive an inbound transfer at the destination. You can:

* Track a quantity in transit
* Define calendars, routings, and inbound and outbound handling times for date calculation and planning. To learn more about planning, go to [About Planning Functionality](production-about-planning-functionality.md).
* Use different warehouse features for inbound and outbound locations.
* With some limitations, you can use transfer orders for direct transfers.

## <a name="item-reclassification-journals"></a>Item reclassification journals

* Simple, direct transfer of items between locations.
* Move items between bins. To learn more about transferring items between bins, go to [Move Items Unplanned in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md)
* Change a lot or serial number to a new lot or serial number. To learn more about reclassifying serial and lot numbers, go to [Reclassify serial or lot numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md#to-reclassify-serial-or-lot-numbers).
* Chang the expiration date to a new date.
* Reclassify items from a *blank* location to an actual location.
* Warehouse activities are not managed. Warehouse entries will be created.

## <a name="to-transfer-items-with-a-transfer-order"></a>To transfer items with a transfer order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Transfer Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If you filled in the **In-Transit Code**, **Shipping Agent Code**, and **Shipping Agent Service** fields on the **Trans. Route Spec.** page when you set up the transfer route, the corresponding fields on the transfer order are filled in automatically.

    When you fill in the **Shipping Agent Service** field, the receipt date at the transfer-to location is calculated by adding the shipping time of the shipping agent service to the shipment date.

3. There are several ways to fill in the lines:

    |Option  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Manually     | On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in a line for an item, or use the **Select items** action to choose multiple items.        |
    |Automatically     | * Choose the **Get Bin Content** action to select existing items from a specific bin at the location.<br><br>* Choose the **Get Receipt Lines** to select items that have just arrived at the transfer-from location.        |

    You can now ship the items.
4. Choose the **Post** action, choose the **Ship** option, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The items are now in transit between the specified locations, according to the specifies transfer route.

    As a warehouse worker at the transfer-from location, proceed to receive the items. The transfer order lines are the same as when shipped and cannot be edited.
5. Choose the **Post** action, choose the **Receive** option, and then choose the **OK** button.

### <a name="post-multiple-transfer-orders-in-a-batch"></a>Post multiple transfer orders in a batch

The following procedure explains how to post transfer orders in a batch.

1. 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Transfer Orders** page, select the orders to post.
3. In the **No.** field, open the context menu and choose **Select More**.
4. Select the checkbox for the lines for each order that you want to post.
5. Choose the **Posting** action, and then choose **Post Batch**.
6. On the **Batch Post Transfer Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

   > [!TIP]
    > For transfer orders that use an in-transit location, you can choose either **Ship** or **Receive**. Repeat this step if you need to do both. For orders where **Direct Posting** is turned on, both options work in the same way and post the order completely.

7. Select **OK**.
8. To view potential issues, open the **Error Message Register** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Posting multiple documents might take some time and block other users. Consider enabling background posting. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks).

### <a name="schedule-a-job-queue-entry-to-post-multiple-documents-in-a-batch"></a>Schedule a job queue entry to post multiple documents in a batch

Alternatively, you can use the job queue to schedule posting to happen at a time that's convenient for your organisation. For example, it might make sense for your business to run certain routines when most of the data entry is done for the day.

The following procedure shows how to set up the **Batch Post Transfer Orders** report to automatically post direct transfer orders at 4 PM on weekdays. That time is just an example. The steps are the same for other documents.  

1. Search for the **Job Queue Entries** page, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, select **Report**.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, select **5707, Batch Post Transfer Orders**.
5. Select the **Report Request Page** checkbox.
6. On the **Batch Post Transfer Orders** request page, choose the **Ship** option, filter on **Direct Transfer**, and then select **OK**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > It's important to set filters. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will post all documents, even if they aren't ready. Consider setting a filter on the **Status** field for the value **Released**, and a filter on the **Posting Date** field for the value **..today**. To learn more about filters, go to [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-enter-criteria-filters).

7. Select all checkboxes from **Run on Mondays** to **Run on Fridays**.
8. In the **Starting Time** field, enter **4 PM**.
9. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclass. Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Item Reclass. Journal** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. In the **Location Code** field, enter the location where the items are currently stored.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To transfer items that have no location code, leave the **Location Code** field blank.
4. In the **New Location Code** field, enter the location that you want to transfer the items to.
5. Choose the **Post** action.

## <a name="undo-a-transfer-shipment"></a>Undo a transfer shipment

If you find a mistake in a quantity on a posted transfer order, as long as the shipment isn't received you can easily correct the quantity. On the **Poster Transfer Shipment** page, the **Undo Shipment** action creates corrective lines, as follows:

* The value in the **Quantity Shipped** field is decreased by the quantity you've undone.
* The value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is increased by the quantity you've undone.
* The **Correction** checkbox is selected for the lines.

If the quantity was shipped in a warehouse shipment, a corrective line is created in the posted warehouse shipment.

To complete the correction, reopen the transfer order, enter the correct quantity, and then post the order. If you're using a warehouse shipment to ship the order, create and post a new warehouse shipment.
