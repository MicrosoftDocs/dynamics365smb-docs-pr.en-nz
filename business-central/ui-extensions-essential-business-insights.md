# <a name="the-essential-business-insights-extension"></a>The Essential Business Insights Extension
The Essential Business Insights extension finds interesting business facts in your company data and displays them as newspaper-like headlines in Role Centres. Depending on what the extension finds in the data, the insights are from the last week, month, or three months from the current date. The insights update every 10 minutes.  

If you want to take a closer look at an insight, you can choose it to go to its source. For example, if you want details about the largest sales invoice that was posted last week, you can choose the insight to display the invoice.

The following table describes the insights that this extension provides for each Role Centre.
