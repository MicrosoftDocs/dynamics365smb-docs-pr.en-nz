# <a name="send-remittance-advice"></a>Send Remittance Advice
Where remittance advice is used to notify vendors of payments being made, you can now email remittance advice in bulk from the payment journal as well as resend after payments are made from vendor ledger entries by using document sending profiles.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality is only supported in Business Central online and on-premises in following countries: United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.  

You can send remittance advice in two different ways:

* In the **Payment Journal** page, choose **Navigate**, **Payments**, **Send Remittance Advice** to email remittance advice for one or multiple payment journal lines
* I the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page, choose Action, Functions, Send Remittance Advice to email remittance advice after posting of vendor payments, for one of multiple vendor ledger entries
