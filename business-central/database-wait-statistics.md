The administrators and developers can have insights into the database performance by looking at **Database Wait Statistics** in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The information presented by **Database Wait Statistics** can help to check the kind of resources that are being used and the kind of delays that are being faced by the database processes. By analysing these wait statistics, you can find the root cause of the slow performance by your database and can eventually make better decisions for the application performance.
