# <a name="general-business-functionality"></a>General Business Functionality
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] provides dedicated functionality for typical business areas, such as finance and sales. For more information, see [Business Functionality](across-business-functionality.md).

To support those business area-specific tasks, you can use a variety of general business functionality, such as defining extended text for document lines and organising connecting business tasks in workflows.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the business-related functions described in this section, you will use general UI functions every day to interact with the system. For more information, see [Working with Business Central](ui-work-product.md).

The following table lists these general business areas with links to topics that describe them.
