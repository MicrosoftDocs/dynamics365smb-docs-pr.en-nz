Just as you can use bank account information on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to keep track of your company's banking transactions, you can also set banking details for vendors. Vendor bank account data can simplify payments to suppliers when combined with the [AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals Extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md) or the [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md) feature, for example.

If a vendor has one or more bank accounts and you want to set a preferred option for the payment journal lines, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the vendor.
3. On the **Payments** FastTab, choose the default vendor bank account in the **Preferred Bank Account Code** field.
