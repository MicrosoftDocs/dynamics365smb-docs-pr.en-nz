# Archive Documents

You can archive sales and purchase orders, quotes, return orders, and blanket orders. You can archive a sales or purchase document several times, saving a different archived version each time.

For archived sales documents where the original still exists and isn't posted, you can use the **Restore** action to overwrite the current document with an archived version. The action works only for sales documents.

For archived documents where the original is deleted, you can only reuse the content by copying the data, for example, by using the **Copy from Document** action.  

## To set up automatic document archiving

You can set up automatic archiving of sales and purchase orders, quotes, blanket orders, and return orders. When automatic archiving is turned on, a new version of the archived document is created when someone does the following things:

* Changes or deletes a document.
* Prints, downloads, or sends a document by email.
* Converts a quote to an order or invoice.
* Posts an order.

The following procedure describes how to set up automatic archiving of sales documents. The steps are similar for purchase documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Archiving** FastTab, specify whether to turn on automatic archiving for the various types of sales documents. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

The following table describes the options for the **Archive Quotes** field.

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Never**| Don't archive sales quotes when they're deleted.|
|**Question**|Prompt the user to choose whether to archive sales quotes when they're deleted.|
|**Always**|Archive sales quotes automatically when they're deleted.|

## To manually archive a sales order

The following procedure describes how to manually archive a sales order. The steps are similar for all orders, blanket orders, return orders, and quotes.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open a sales order that you want to archive.  
3. Choose the **Archive Document** action.

The sales order is archived. You can view it on the **Archived Sales Orders** page.

## To restore a non-posted sales order from the archive

The following procedure describes how to restore an archived sales order to the original sales order. Restoring a document is only possible when the original document hasn't been posted. The steps are similar for all orders, blanket orders, return orders, and quotes.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order Archives**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the archived sales order, or version of it, that you want to restore, and then choose the **Restore** action.  

The contents of the original sales order are replaced with the archived version.

## To delete archived sales orders

Use a retention policy to clean up archived documents that you no longer need. Retention policies let administrators define how long they want to store data. For example, they can set up a policy that deletes data after an expiration date. For more information, see [Define Retention Policies](admin-data-retention-policies.md).

There are a few things to note about creating retention policies for archived documents:

* *If the original document hasn’t been deleted, Business Central won’t delete the archived versions. Archived versions won’t expire as long as the original exists.
* When you set up the retention policy, you can specify that you want the policy to delete all archived versions of a document except the most recent. For example, you might have 10 versions of a document and want to keep a copy of the latest. 
* Business Central calculates the expiration date for documents based on the date of the most recent archived version.
