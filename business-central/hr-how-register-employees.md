# <a name="register-employees"></a>Register Employees
To use the Human Resources functionality, you must first register each employee by creating a card with all the core and related information.

You can modify an employee's details at any time. Keeping up-to-date records about your employees simplifies personnel tasks. For example, if an employee's address changes, you register this on the employee card.

The following procedures describe how to create an initial employee card and how to assign two types of employee details to an employee. In addition, you can assign various other related information, such as qualifications and causes of inactivity. You assign employee information either by choosing a field or an action in the **Employee Card** window.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can reimburse employees for their expenses during business activities. For this purpose, you must fill in the fields on the **Payments** FastTab in the **Employee Card** window. For more information, see [Record and Reimburse Employees' Expenses](finance-how-record-reimburse-employee-expenses.md).

On the employee card, you can set up information, such as union membership, relatives, and contracts for the employee. The following describes how to set up an alternate address. The steps are similar for all other information that you can set up from an employee card.

You can use alternate addresses to keep track of your employeesâ€™ location, for example if they are stationed abroad, on a long business trip, or residing at a summer residence.

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
