# <a name="configuring-onedrive-integration-with-business-central-on-premises" />Configuring OneDrive Integration with Business Central On-premises

This article explains how to configure OneDrive integration with Business Central on-premises. Unlike [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the connection between Business Central and OneDrive for Business isn't set up automatically. If the connection isn't configured, users can't use the features for OneDrive.

There are two tasks that need to be done to configure the OneDrive integration.

- The first task involves registering an application (app) on your Azure Active Directory tenant of your Microsoft 365 plan. The registered app is used for authentication purposes. This task is typically done in the Azure portal and in Business Central web client.
- The second task involves setting up the connection to the OneDrive URL and turning on the OneDrive features in the Business Central. This task in done in the Business Central web client. It's done differently for version 21 than for versions 19 and 20. Version 21 introduces a new **OneDrive Setup** that replaces the **SharePoint Connections Setup**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises can only be connected to OneDrive hosted by Microsoft in the cloud. Connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises to the My Sites repository of SharePoint Server isn't supported.

## <a name="register-an-app-in-azure-ad-for-onedrive-integration" /><a name="registerapp"></a>Register an app in Azure AD for OneDrive integration

In this task, you add a registered app for Business Central in the Azure AD tenant of your Microsoft 365 plan. Like other Azure services that work with Business Central, OneDrive requires a registered app in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The registered app provides authentication and authorisation services between Business Central and SharePoint, which is used by OneDrive.

For detailed steps for completing this step, see [Register an application in Azure Active Directory](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory) in the developer and IT pro help.

As you register the application, consider the following points:

- If you've already registered an application as part of an integration with another Microsoft product, such as Power BI, then you reuse that registered app. In this case, you'll just have to set the SharePoint permissions for the existing registered app.

- Be sure to configure the registered app with the following delegated permissions to the SharePoint API:

    - AllSites.FullControl
    - User.ReadWrite.All
    
    For Business Central 2021 release wave 2 (version 19), set these permissions instead:
    
    - AllSites.Write
    - MyFiles.Write
    - User.Read.All 

- If you're using Business Central version 19 or 20, copy the **Application (client) ID** and **client secret** used by the registered app. You'll need this information in the next task.

## <a name="set-up-the-onedrive-connection-in-version-21-and-later" />Set up the OneDrive connection in version 21 and later

Use this procedure if you're using Business Central 2022 release wave 2 (version 21) or later.

### <a name="prerequisites" />Prerequisites

- Indirect, modify, and delete (imd) permission on table **Document Service Scenario** as a minimum

### <a name="run-onedrive-setup" />Run OneDrive Setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **OneDrive Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. The first time you run the assisted setup, you'll see the **Your privacy**. Read the information on the page, and if you agree to the terms choose **Agree** to continue.
3. On the **Configure file handling** page, you have the following options to choose from:

   [!INCLUDE[onedrive-feature-options](includes/onedrive-feature-options.md)]

4. On the **Configure Business Central** page, enter OneDrive's URL in the **OneDrive URL** field.

   [How do I find my OneDrive URL?](#url)
5. Choose **Test Connection** and wait for the results.
   - If the test succeeds, choose **Done**, then you're ready to go.
   - If the test fails, you'll get a message that describes the problem. Typically the problem has to do with the URL that you provided. Choose **OK** to return to the **Configure Business Central** page, verify the URL, and try again.
   - If you haven't already set up the Azure AD registered app, the **Set Up Azure Active Directory** guide opens.
6. When completed, the privacy notice for OneDrive integration is agreed for all users. If you want to change it so users must agree or disagree for themselves, then go the **Privacy Notices Status** page and select **Let User Decide** for the OneDrive integration. Users will then be prompted to agree or disagree with the privacy notice the first time they use the OneDrive features. For more information, see [Privacy Notices](privacy-notices-status.md).

## <a name="set-up-the-connection-in--version-19-and-20" />Set up the connection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 19 and 20

Use this procedure if you're using Business Central 2022 release wave 1 (version 20) or 2021 release wave 2 (version 19).
> [!IMPORTANT]
> By configuring this feature, you also enable legacy features that send files to OneDrive.  
>
>* The Open in Excel feature will automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. 
>* Exporting any report to a file will automatically copy the file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online, Word Online or OneDrive. 
>* Other features may also automatically open in OneDrive.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft SharePoint Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the connection, like **OneDrive**.
3. In the **Folder** field, enter **Business Central**.
4. In the **Location** field, enter the URL for your OneDrive.

   [How do I find my OneDrive URL?](#url)
5. In the **Client ID** field, enter the client ID from your registered app.
6. In the **Client Secret** field, enter the secret from your registered app. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **SharePoint Connection Setup** page is used to configure multiple legacy features. The **General** section configures the connection to OneDrive, and the **Shared Documents** section redirects files to SharePoint instead. The  **SharePoint Connection Setup** has been deprecated and will be removed in coming release. We recommend that you do not configure the **Shared Documents** section. For more information, see [Deprecated Features in the Base App ](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#microsoft-sharepoint-connection-setup).

## <a name="after-upgrade-to-version-21" />After upgrade to version 21

When you upgrade to version 21 or later, the existing connection to OneDrive that's configured on the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page will still work. But because the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page will be removed in version 23, we recommend that you switch to the new OneDrive integration, as described in the next section. Making this switch now will make it easier when the **SharePoint Connection Setup** is eventually removed. Plus, it will enable you to use the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide to manage the OneDrive features that are accessible to users.

## <a name="switching-from-legacy-sharepoint-to-new-onedrive-integration" />Switching from legacy SharePoint to new OneDrive integration

To switch to the new OneDrive integration, you run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide, which you can open directly or from the legacy **SharePoint Connection Setup** page. The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup will lead you through the transition, providing information about the changes being made along the way.

Before you get started with the switch or as you're doing it, refer to the next section to learn about some aspects and considerations about the process. 

### <a name="about-switching-to-the-new-onedrive-integration" /><a name="onedrivesetupmigration"></a>About switching to the new OneDrive integration

In addition to OneDrive integration, Business Central can also integrate with other services, like Power BI and Universal print. Integration with these other services also requires a registered Azure AD app for authentication. The Azure AD app used by these other services is configured in the **Set up your Azure Active Directory accounts** assisted setup. When you switch from the legacy SharePoint connection setup, the new **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup will change your OneDrive integration to also use the **Set up your Azure Active Directory accounts** assisted setup&mdash;so all integrations use the same Azure AD app.

This change has implications when switching to the new OneDrive integration, depending on whether there's already an Azure AD app configured in the **Set up your Azure Active Directory accounts** assisted setup. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you switch to the new OneDrive setup, you can no longer use the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page to configure OneDrive integration.

#### <a name="how-the-changes-affect-the-integration" />How the changes affect the integration

The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup will always use the app that's configured in the **Set up your Azure Active Directory accounts** assisted setup, if there's one. When you run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup, it will compare the app configured in **Set up your Azure Active Directory accounts** with your current app configured in **SharePoint Connection Setup**.

> [!TIP]
> In the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page and **Set up your Azure Active Directory accounts** assisted setup, the Azure AD app is identified by the **client ID**.

- If the app in **Set up your Azure Active Directory accounts** is different than the app in **SharePoint Connection Setup**, the OneDrive integration will change to use the app in **Set up your Azure Active Directory accounts**.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you'll get a message similar to the following text: 

  `The Azure Active Directory Application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations. This means the client id will change to NNNNNNNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNNNNNNNNNN, you may want to test it has the correct permissions.`

  `NNNNNNNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNNNNNNNNNN` represents the client ID of the app in **Set up your Azure Active Directory accounts** that OneDrive integration has been switched to. 

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > For new OneDrive integration to work after you make the switch, you have to grant the app permission to the SharePoint API in Azure portal. You can do this step before or after you switch to the new OneDrive setup. For more information, see the section [Register an app in Azure AD for OneDrive integration](#registerapp).

- If the app in **Set up your Azure Active Directory accounts** is the same as the app in **SharePoint Connection Setup**, the OneDrive integration will use the same app as before, except from the configuration in the **Set up your Azure Active Directory accounts** setup.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch,, you'll get a message similar to the following text:

    `The Azure Active Directory Application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations. This has already been configured with the same client id (5F78CADE-19C0-49BF-AF84-306D0579B50E).`

- If there's no app configured in the **Set up your Azure Active Directory accounts** setup, the OneDrive integration will use the same app as before.

   The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup will copy app configuration to the **Set up your Azure Active Directory accounts** setup, so it will be used for other integrations in that might set up later.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you'll get a message similar to the following text:

   `The Azure Active Directory Application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations`.

### <a name="run-onedrive-setup-to-switch-to-the-new-onedrive-integration" />Run OneDrive setup to switch to the new OneDrive integration

1. Open either the **OneDrive Setup** page or the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page.
2. If you're using the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page, choose **Go to new OneDrive setup** in the notification at the top of the page.
3. Follow the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide.
4. When you get to the **Configure file handling** page, choose one of the following options for turning on features:

   [!INCLUDE[onedrive-feature-options](includes/onedrive-feature-options.md)]

5. The **Configure Business Central** page shows the same URL that's used by the existing OneDrive integration. You can change the URL as needed.
6. Select **Test Connection** and follow the instructions.

   If the test succeeds, select **done**, and you're ready to go. Otherwise, use the messages on the page to help you fix the problem.
