# <a name="reserve-items"></a>Reserve Items

You can reserve items for sales orders, purchase orders, service orders, assembly orders, transfer orders, and production orders. You can also reserve items in inventory or inbound on open document or journal lines. You do this on the **Reservation** page.

Each line you open to reserve items on the **Reservation** page displays information about one type of line (sales, purchase, or journal) or inventory entry. The lines describe how many items are available to be reserved from each type of line or entry.

The quantity you entered in the firm planned production order line is now reserved.

## <a name="reserve-a-specific-serial-or-lot-number"></a>Reserve a specific serial or lot number

From outbound documents for item-tracked items, such as sales orders or production component lists, you can reserve specific serial or lot numbers. This may be relevant, for example, if you need production components from a specific lot to ensure consistency with earlier production batches, or because a customer has requested a specific serial number. Learn more at [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).

This practice is referred to as a specific reservation, because you reserve from the quantity of item X that belongs to lot X. In contrast, if you reserve only from quantities of item X, then it is simply a normal, non-specific, reservation. Learn more at [Design Details - Item Tracking and Reservations](design-details-item-tracking-and-reservations.md).

The following procedure is based on a sales order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then select the related link.  
2. Create a sales order line for an item-tracked item.  
3. Assign serial and lot numbers to the sales order line. Learn more at [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).
4. On the sales order line, choose the **Reserve** action.  
5. Choose the **Yes** button to reserve specific serial or lot numbers.  
6. On the **Item Tracking List** page, select the serial and lot number combination you have assigned.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to open the **Reservation** page showing only supply with the specified item tracking number. If there are any non-specific reservations on any of the item tracking numbers you've specified for this line, you're informed of the quantity that has already been reserved.  
8. Choose either the **Auto Reserve** or the **Reserve from Current Line** action to create the reservation of the specific item tracking numbers.
