# <a name="manage-project-supplies"></a>Manage Project Supplies

You should manage project supplies of items, services, and expenses as an integral and critical aspect of all projects. You can use inventory quantities or make project-specific purchases through purchase orders or purchase invoices. For example, a service project on a computer requires a new disk. You create a purchase invoice to buy a new disk and record the project that uses it.

If the purchase process doesn't require you to record the physical transaction separately, you can process a purchase on the **Project G/L Journal** page. For more information, see [To post a project-related expense](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md#to-post-a-project-related-expense).

The following procedure shows how to use a purchase invoice to purchase products for a project. The same steps apply when using a purchase order.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action and fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. In the **Project No.** and **Project Task No.** fields, select the information of the project that you want to purchase items or services for. Use the personalisation tools if a field isn't visible. For more information, see [Personalise Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

    The value that you select in the **Project Line Type** field defines whether a planning line is created when you post the usage of the item. If the field contains **Billable**, then project planning lines that are ready to be invoiced to the customer are created. For more information, see [Invoice Projects](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md).
4. Choose the **Post** action.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project card.

    On the **Tasks** FastTab, the **Outstanding Orders** field shows the total outstanding amount, in local currency, of inventory items and services on purchase documents for the project task line.  

    The **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced** field shows the value of items delivered on purchase documents, but not yet invoiced.  
3. Choose either of the fields to open the **Purchase Lines** page where you can review information about the related purchase document lines, including which items or services are received.

If you incur extraordinary or one-time project expenses, you can use the **Project G/L Journal** page to post them directly to the relevant project account.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new line and enter information about the expense, including information in the **Project No.** and **Project Task No** fields.  
3. When the journal is complete, choose the **Post** action.
