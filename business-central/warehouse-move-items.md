title: Move Items | Microsoft Docs
description: While in inventory, items may need to be moved between bins to support the daily warehouse activities involved in keeping items flowing through the warehouse. Some movements happen in direct relation to internal operations, such as a production order that needs components delivered or end items put away. Other movements happen as mere warehouse space optimisation or as ad-hoc movements to and from operations.
