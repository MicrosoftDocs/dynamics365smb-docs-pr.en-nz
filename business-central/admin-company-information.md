# <a name="company-information-overview"></a>Company Information Overview

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] organises business entities in *companies*. For each company, you must fill in some of the basic company details and relevant information in the **Company Information** page. The information in the [**Company Information**](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1) page is used in documents, such as invoice headers. You can set up more than one company, such as a parent company and a subsidiary.  

If the company's inventory warehouse is located at a different address than company headquarters, you can complete the various ship-to fields and the **Location Code** field on the **Shipping** FastTab. Then, the information in these fields will be printed on purchase orders, for example, so that vendors will ship items to the correct location.  

For each company that you set up, you must fill in the **Company Information** page, together with the **General Ledger Setup** page. You must also set up each area in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, for each company. For more information, see [Overview of Tasks to Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](setup.md).  

The **Company Information** page contains different fields and FastTabs, depending on your country. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] The following table describes the most commonly used FastTabs.

[!INCLUDE [admin-company-info-fasttabs](includes/admin-company-info-fasttabs.md)]

Once you have completed filling in the information, you can close the page.  

## <a name="work-with-multiple-companies"></a>Work with multiple companies

If your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes multiple companies, your users might want to use *company badges* to keep track of which company they are currently working in. For more information, see [Display a company badge for quick access to company information](ui-change-basic-settings.md#badge).  

## <a name="experience"></a>Experience

The default user experience in a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial does not reveal all capabilities. You can switch on the full experience in the **Company Information** page. For more information, see [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).
