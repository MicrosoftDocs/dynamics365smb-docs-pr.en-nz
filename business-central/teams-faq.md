# <a name="teams-faq"></a>Teams FAQ

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article answers some of the questions you may have about working with Teams and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## <a name="general"></a>[General](#tab/general)

### <a name="how-do-i-sign-in-to-the-prod_shortmd-app-in-teams"></a>How do I sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams? 

After installing the app, you'll be asked to sign in the first time you paste a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] link into Teams chat or when you choose the **Details** action on a card in Teams. Depending on your Teams client, you may have to enter your credentials that you use to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

### <a name="how-do-i-sign-out-of-the-prod_shortmd-app-in-teams"></a>How do I sign out of the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams? 

To sign out of your current user identity in Teams used to connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], go to any chat compose box, and choose the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] icon underneath. When the window appears, check your currently signed in identity and then choose **Sign out**. If you're using Teams in the browser, you'll also be signed out of any [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] web client in the same browser window.

### <a name="does-the-app-for-teams-connect-to-prod_shortmd-on-premises"></a>Does the app for Teams connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises? 

No. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams only works with [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] online. There are no plans to support [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] deployment types&mdash;like on-premises, hybrid cloud, or private cloud&mdash;that Microsoft doesn't host or manage directly.

### <a name="does-the-app-work-with-multiple-companies-and-environments"></a>Does the app work with multiple companies and environments? 

Yes. When the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app expands a link into a card, the link must contain the environment and company names for the app to match the record in the right company. You can paste links to any companies and environments you have access to within your organisation and from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] account you used to sign in. Participants in the chat will see the card. But they can't view the card details unless they have permissions to the company or environment where that record is stored.

### <a name="in-which-countries-or-regions-is-the-prod_shortmd-app-available"></a>In which countries or regions is the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app available? 

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams isn't restricted by country or region. The app is available in all markets currently supported by the Teams marketplace. 

### <a name="does-the-prod_shortmd-app-work-with-any-localization-of-prod_shortmd"></a>Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work with any localisation of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]? 

Yes. The app is intended to work with any localisation of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], whether that localisation is offered directly from Microsoft or through a partner. For more information, see [Country/regional availability and supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).

### <a name="which-languages-does-the-prod_shortmd-app-support"></a><a name="language"></a>Which languages does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app support?
<!--TODO Run by Mike -->

Two things determine the language used for cards and card details in Teams:

1. Your language in Teams, which you can see from your account settings in Teams. 
2. Your language in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], which you can see the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client (see [Change Basic Setting - Language](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language)).

The following table explains how the experience differs for message authors and recipients, depending on language settings and availability of languages.

|Who|Card|Card details |
|-|----|--------------| 
|Message author |Displays in the language that's specified for you in Teams. If [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't offer that same language, the card is displayed in English. |Displayed in the language that's specified for you in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].  which may include languages from language apps provided by partners. |
|Message recipient |Displays in the language of the message author. |Displays in the language that's specified for you in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. |

For the list of supported languages for [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], see [Supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json#supported-languages).

### <a name="where-can-i-find-teams-integration-inside-the-prod_shortmd-web-client"></a>Where can I find Teams integration inside the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client? 

There's currently no embedding of Teams controls or presence of Teams features inside the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client or other clients.  

### <a name="does-prod_shortmd-work-with-the-teams-mobile-app"></a>Does [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] work with the Teams mobile app?

Yes. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app can be installed from the Teams desktop app or browser, or by an administrator for all users. Once installed, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app is automatically available in Teams for iOS and Android. On mobile devices, you can view cards sent by others, access details, or pop out the card to the full experience in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. However, you can't paste links that expand into cards when composing messages. For minimum requirements for mobile, see [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md).

### <a name="is-the-prod_shortmd-app-for-teams-the-same-as-the-prod_shortmd-app-for-ios-and-android"></a>Is the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams the same as the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for iOS and Android? 

No. The app for Teams is an add-in to Microsoft Teams and exclusively designed for collaborative experiences that light up within Teams. On the other hand, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app delivers a rich experience for you to work with [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] data on your mobile devices.

Mobile users are encouraged to install both the mobile app and the app for Teams to get the most out of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. With both installed, you can choose the **Pop out** action on a card in Teams to open the card details in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. For information about installing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and Teams mobile apps, see:

- [Get Business Central on Your Mobile Device](install-mobile-app.md)
- [Get the Teams mobile app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/download-the-mobile-app-for-teams-5940ebdc-0082-4fb1-83c4-751edc23dcb5) on Microsoft Support

### <a name="does-the-prod_shortmd-app-work-in-all-teams-clients"></a>Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work in all Teams clients?

No. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams isn't supported when installed as a package for macOS or Linux. On these platforms, you can access Teams using a supported browser instead.

For minimum requirements in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], see [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md#teams).

For information about the choice of Teams clients and how to install them, see [Get clients for Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/get-clients) in the Teams documentation.

### <a name="which-teams-client-is-best-for-prod_shortmd"></a>Which Teams client is best for [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]?

There are only minor differences and limitations between Teams clients that may affect your experience with the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams. When choosing a Teams client, consider:

- The camera and location can't be accessed from the details window in the Teams desktop app 
- Using Microsoft Edge with the Teams in the browser let's you easily work across multiple identities and accounts by signing in to Teams from different profiles. To learn about using profiles in Microsoft Edge, see [Sign in and create multiple profiles in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/office/sign-in-and-create-multiple-profiles-in-microsoft-edge-df94e622-2061-49ae-ad1d-6f0e43ce6435) on Microsoft Support.

### <a name="what-is-the-best-way-for-me-to-demonstrate-prod_shortmd-and-microsoft-teams-to-prospective-customers"></a>What is the best way for me to demonstrate [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and Microsoft Teams to prospective customers?

If you're a reselling partner, you might want to have an environment that you can show prospects as part of pre-sales demonstrations. To avoid affecting Microsoft Teams in your organisation, you can get a Microsoft 365 demo account at [https://aka.ms/CDX](https://aka.ms/CDX). This account gives you full control of an independent Azure organisation that includes Microsoft Teams and [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Preparing Demonstration Environments of Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/demo-environment).

### <a name="does-the-prod_shortmd-app-for-teams-cater-for-my-customization-and-personalization"></a>Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams cater for my customisation and personalisation?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams can display cards for links to customer pages and tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], such as those pages and tables originating from your own custom extensions or from AppSource.

The fields shown on a card in Teams can also be affected by [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] customisations installed for your organisation. Cards don't consider any role-specific customisations or user personalisation. However, the card details window shows record details as you would see them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], including any extensions, role customisations, and user personalisation.

### <a name="where-can-i-learn-about-my-privacy"></a>Where can I learn about my privacy? 

You can learn about how Microsoft handles your data in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2030602). 

Contact your administrator to learn how your organisation handles the privacy of your data. 

### <a name="how-do-i-uninstall-the-prod_shortmd-app-for-teams"></a>How do I uninstall the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams? 

To remove the app that you installed for yourself, go to any chat compose box, find the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] icon underneath, right-click the icon and choose Uninstall.  

### <a name="will-microsoft-continue-to-improve-the-prod_shortmd-app-for-teams"></a>Will Microsoft continue to improve the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

At Microsoft, we're constantly listening to feedback from our diverse user community and acting upon the top suggestions. To learn about what is next for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, see the [Dynamics 365 release plan](https://aka.ms/dynamics365releaseplan).

## <a name="working-with-cards"></a>[Working with cards](#tab/cards)

### <a name="which-types-of-links-does-the-app-support"></a>Which types of links does the app support?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams reacts to most [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client links. When the link refers to a single record on a page, the card will display fields for that record. The supported page types include: 

- Card pages, such as the Item card
- Document pages, such as the Sales Order document
- ListPlus pages that represent a single record composed of other records, such as a Bank Account Reconciliation statement
- Simple list pages where a record doesn't offer the ability to drill down into a separate details page, such as the Postcodes list

When pasting a link to the root Web client Url, such as https://businesscentral.dynamics.com, the card instead displays information to help new users get started with accessing [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### <a name="how-do-i-delete-a-card-i-sent-to-a-chat"></a>How do I delete a card I sent to a chat? 

You can't delete a card that you've already sent to chat. But you can delete the entire message that the card is a part of.

As the message author, you can delete any messages you sent to chats with a person, group, or channel&mdash;unless your administrator has set up policies that prevent deleting messages. If you moderate a channel as a channel owner, your administrator may have also granted you permission to delete any messages in the channel, including those messages sent by other users.

Deleting a message that contains a card doesn't delete or affect any data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### <a name="do-cards-always-show-up-to-date-information"></a>Do cards always show up-to-date information?

No. The field values on a card in Teams, including any images, are based on the data available when that card was sent to the chat. [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] cards don't automatically refresh in Teams. 

### <a name="will-others-see-my-card-if-they-dont-have-the-prod_shortmd-app-for-teams"></a>Will others see my card if they don’t have the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams? 

When you compose and send a message to chat that includes a card, all users will see the card, even if they haven't installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams.

## <a name="working-with-card-details"></a>[Working with card details](#tab/carddetails)

### <a name="where-is-the-save-button-in-the-details-window-in-teams"></a>Where is the save button in the details window in Teams? 

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically saves changes you make to any field as soon as you leave the field. To leave a field, click/tap anywhere outside the field or use the Tab key to move to the next field. When data appears in a dialogue within the details window, you may need to choose the **OK** button to have [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] save your changes.

### <a name="if-i-choose-to-view-details-for-a-card-will-other-users-see-my-details-window"></a>If I choose to view details for a card, will other users see my details window? 

No. While everyone in the chat can view the card itself, the details window only appears for you on your device when you choose **Details**. Other users must choose **Details** if they would like to view the details window on their device.

### <a name="can-i-start-a-teams-call-from-the-details-window-in-teams"></a>Can I start a Teams call from the details window in Teams? 

Yes. You can start a call by choosing the linked dialing number in a phone number field, such as the **Mobile Phone No.** field on the **Contact** card. Teams must be your designated dialing app.

To call local or international landlines and mobile phones from Teams, you must have a Teams licence for enterprise calling. Also, you must set up Teams as your call solution. To learn more, see [Plan your Teams voice solution](/microsoftteams/cloud-voice-landing-page) in the Teams documentation.

### <a name="can-i-print-documents-from-the-details-window-in-teams"></a>Can I print documents from the details window in Teams? 

Yes. You print reports and other documents using standard [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] printing functionality and any cloud-enabled printer configured in the **Printer Management** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can't print from Teams to local printers known to your client device, such as printers that you'd typically print to from your browser. For this reason, you can't print from the report preview window, but only from the main report request page, directly to your cloud printers.

For more information about setting up cloud printers, see [Set Up Printers](ui-specify-printer-selection-reports.md).

### <a name="can-i-access-the-camera-from-the-details-window-in-teams"></a>Can I access the camera from the details window in Teams? 

Yes. Any [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features in the details window that use the camera are available on all Teams clients.

### <a name="can-i-access-my-location-from-the-details-window-in-teams"></a><a name="location"></a>Can I access my location from the details window in Teams?

If you’re using functionality in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] that accesses your current location coordinates, such as with maps, you must use Teams in the browser or the Teams mobile app. Location isn't available when using the Teams desktop app. 

## <a name="collaborating-with-guests"></a>[Collaborating with guests ](#tab/collaborating)

### <a name="can-i-share-cards-with-users-outside-my-organization"></a>Can I share cards with users outside my organisation? 

Yes. When you compose and send a message that includes a card, all recipients in the chat will see the card&mdash;even if they're guests or external to your organisation. Guests can also open the details window if they've been granted permissions to access that data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### <a name="is-the-experience-any-different-for-users-that-are-guests"></a>Is the experience any different for users that are guests?

Yes. Inviting guest users from outside your organisation to participate in chat or a channel gives them a similar, but not identical experience compared to users within your organisation. When a guest receives a message that includes a card, they can view it. Guests can also open the details window if they have been granted permissions to access that data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and assigned a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] licence within your organisation. When a guest composes a message, links to your [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] won't expand into cards.

To learn about other similarities and differences between guests and team members, see [Guest experience in Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/guest-experience) in the Teams documentation.

### <a name="how-does-a-guest-user-install-the-prod_shortmd-app"></a>How does a guest user install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app? 

Guests don't have access to the app marketplace to install apps themselves. However, the app can be automatically installed for them based on your organisation’s policies. Another way for a guest user to install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app is when they receive a chat message that includes a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] card. In this case, the user chooses the **Details** button or the menu on the card, then installs the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for use with your organisation. After installing the app, a user doesn't automatically receive any permissions to access data from your [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].
