# <a name="assembly-management" />Assembly Management

Companies can supply products to customers by combining components without using manufacturing features. Features for assembling items integrate with related features such as sales, planning, reservations, and warehousing.  

An assembly item is a sellable item that contains an assembly BOM. To learn more about assembly BOMs, go to [Work with Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md).

Assembly orders are internal orders, just like production orders. Use assembly orders to manage the assembly process and to connect sales requirements with warehouse activities. Assembly orders involve both output and consumption when posting. Assembly order headers are similar to output journal lines. Assembly order lines are similar to consumption journal lines.  

You can use a just-in-time inventory strategy and customise products to meet customer requests. Assembly orders can be automatically created and linked when you create a sales order line. The link between the sales demand and assembly supply opens up for several opportunities when you process sales orders:

* Customise assembly items on the fly.
* Promise delivery dates according to component availability.
* Post output and shipment of the assembled item directly from their sales orders.

To learn more about selling assembly items, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

Lines on sales orders can contain items to pick from stock and items to assemble for the order. The assemble-to-order quantities take priority over inventory quantities in partial shipping. To learn more about selling stock and assembly items, go to [Combination Scenarios](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#combination-scenarios).  

When an assemble-to-order quantity is ready to ship, a warehouse employee can post an inventory pick for the sales order lines. Posting an inventory pick does a couple of things:

* Create an inventory movement for the components
* Post the assembly output and the sales order shipment.

To learn more about assemble-to-order items and inventory picks, go to [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).
