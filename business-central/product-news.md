# <a name="whats-new-in-dynamics-365-business-central"></a>What's New in Dynamics 365 Business Central

This page points you to topics that can help you learn about the new features in the latest versions of [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. If you haven't already, then sign up for a [trial](https://trials.dynamics.com/), get introduced to the basics of what you can do with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], and then try things out on your own for a while. When you are ready, you can open a blank company and set things up for yourself.  

On a regular basis, we will update [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] with additional capabilities in the core application and with new [extensions](ui-extensions.md).  

[!include [release notes](includes/release-notes.md)]

We also talk about new capabilities on [the Business Central blog](https://community.dynamics.com/business/b/financials/), including when they are made available, and if there are special considerations.
