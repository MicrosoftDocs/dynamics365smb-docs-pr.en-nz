# <a name="why-a-page-is-locked-from-personalizing"></a>Why a Page is Locked From Personalising
If there is a lock icon in the **Personalising** bar when you open a page (as shown), this means that you are currently prevented from making any more personalisation changes to the page.

![Personalise Lock](media/personalization-locked.png "Personalise lock")

This is because we changed the way personalisation works behind the scenes since the last time that you personalised the page. Unfortunately, the old way and new of doing things do not work together.

The page currently includes the last personalisation changes that you made. If you want to continue personalising the page, then you can choose the lock icon and then **Unlock**. Just be aware that if you choose to unlock the page, the current personalisation of the page will be cleared, and you will have to start from scratch.
