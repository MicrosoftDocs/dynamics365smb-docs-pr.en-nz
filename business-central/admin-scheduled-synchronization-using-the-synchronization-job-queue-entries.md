# <a name="scheduling-a-synchronization-between-business-central-and-dynamics-365-sales"></a>Scheduling a Synchronisation between Business Central and Dynamics 365 Sales
You can synchronise [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] on scheduled intervals by setting up jobs in the job queue. The synchronisation jobs synchronise data in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] records and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] records that have been previously coupled together. Or for records that are not already coupled, depending on the synchronisation direction and rules, the synchronisation jobs can create and couple new records in the destination system. There are several synchronisation jobs that are available out-of-the-box. You can view them on the **Job Queue Entries** page. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).
<!--
> [!Note]
> For the on-premeses version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], the synchronization jobs are run by codeunit **5339 Integration synch Job Runner**.-->

## <a name="synchronization-process"></a>Synchronisation Process  
Each synchronisation job queue entry uses a specific integration table mapping that specifies which [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] entity to synchronise. The table mappings also include some settings that control which records in the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] entity to synchronise.  

To synchronise data, [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] entity records must be coupled to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] records. For example, a [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] customer must be coupled to a [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] account. You can set up couplings manually, before running the synchronisation jobs, or let the synchronisation jobs set up couplings automatically. The following list describes how data is synchronised between [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] when you are using the synchronisation job queue entries. For more information, see [Couple and Synchronise Records Manually](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md).

-   By default, only records in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] that are coupled to records in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] are synchronised. You can change the table mapping between a [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] entity and a [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] table so that the integration synchronisation jobs will create new records in the destination database for each record in the source database that is not coupled. The new records are also coupled to the corresponding records in the source. For example, when you synchronise customers with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] accounts, a new account record is created for each customer in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. The new accounts are automatically coupled to customers in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. Because the synchronisation in this case is bidirectional, a new customer is created and coupled for each [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] account that is not already coupled.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > There are rules and filters that determine what data is synchronised. For more information, see [Synchronisation Rules](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#synchronization-rules).

-   When new records are created in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], the records use the either the template that is defined for the integration table mapping or the default template that is available for the record type. Fields are populated with data from [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] depending on the synchronisation direction. For more information, see [Modify Table Mappings for Synchronisation](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md).  

-   With subsequent synchronisations, only records that have been modified or added after the last successful synchronisation job for the entity will be updated.  

     New records in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] are added in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. If data in fields in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] records has changed, the data is copied to the corresponding field in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  

-   With bidirectional synchronisation, the job synchronises from [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], and then from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].
