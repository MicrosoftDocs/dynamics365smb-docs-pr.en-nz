You can encrypt data on the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] server by generating new or importing existing encryption keys that you enable on the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] server instance that connects to the database.

For more information, see [Encrypting Data in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-encrypting-data) in Developer and IT-Pro help.

> [!Note]
> You can turn on or turn off encryption only if you are using an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. Encryption is always turned on for online versions, and you cannot turn it off.
