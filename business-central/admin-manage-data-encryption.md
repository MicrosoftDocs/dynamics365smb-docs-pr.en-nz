# <a name="managing-data-encryption"></a>Managing data encryption
You can encrypt data on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server by generating new or importing existing encryption keys that you enable on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server instance that connects to the database.

For more information, see [Encrypting Data in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-encrypting-data) in Developer and IT-Pro help.

> [!Note]
> You can turn on or turn off encryption only if you are using an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Encryption is always turned on for online versions, and you cannot turn it off.
