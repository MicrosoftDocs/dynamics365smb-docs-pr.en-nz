# <a name="create-workflows-to-connect-tasks-in-business-processes"></a>Create Workflows to Connect Tasks in Business Processes

You can create workflows that connect tasks in business processes that are performed by different users. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in workflows, preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps.  

On the **Workflow** page, create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event moderated by event conditions and a workflow response with response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code.  

[!INCLUDE[workflow](includes/workflow.md)]

When you create workflows, you can copy the steps from existing workflows or from workflow templates. Workflow templates represent non-editable workflows that exist in the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The code for workflow templates added by Microsoft are prefixed with "MS-", such as in "MS-PIW". Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> All notifications about workflow steps are sent through a job queue. Make sure the job queue reflects your business needs. Learn more at [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

The workflow is divided into three sections:

1. **When Event**  
   This is where the trigger is selected.  
   Examples of a trigger:
   * A master data record is changed
   * A journal line is created
   * An incoming document is created or released
   * Approval of a document is requested
2. **On Condition**  
   The **conditions** are related to the event and allows creating filters to decide on how the workflow continues.
3. **Then Response**  
   The **responses** specify the next steps in the workflow.

For both events and responses, the options are system-defined. New ones must be added through the development of an extension.

## <a name="to-create-a-workflow"></a>To create a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **Workflow** page opens.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter a maximum of 20 characters to identify the workflow.  
4. To create the workflow from a workflow template, on the **Workflows** page, choose the **New Workflow from Template** action. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).  
5. In the **Description** field, describe the workflow.  
6. In the **Category** field, specify which category the workflow belongs to.  
7. In the **When Event** field, specify the event that must occur to start the workflow step.  

   When you choose the field, the **Workflow Events** page opens so you can select from all available workflow events.  
8. In the **On Condition** field, specify one or more conditions that must be met before the event in the **When Event** field can occur.  

   When you choose the field, the **Event Conditions** page opens so you can choose from a list of filter fields that are relevant as conditions for the event in question. You can add new filter fields you want to use as event conditions. You set event condition filters just as you set filters on report request pages.  

   If the workflow event is the change of a specific field on a record, then the **Event Conditions** page opens with options to select the field and the type of change.  

   1. To specify a field change for the event, on the **Event Conditions** page, in the **Field** field, select the field that changes.  
   2. In the **Operator** field, select either **Decreased**, **Increased**, or **Changed**.  
9. In the **Then Response** field, specify the response that will follow when the workflow event occurs.  

   When you choose the field, the **Workflow Responses** page opens where so you can select from all available workflow responses and set response options for the selected response.  
10. On the **Options for the Selected Response** FastTab, specify options for the workflow response by selecting values in the different fields that appear, as follows:  

    1. To specify options for a workflow response that involves sending a notification, fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > These fields vary, depending on the response you've chosen.

       |Field|Description|
       |-----|-----------|
       |**Notify Sender**|Specify if the approval requestor is notified instead of the approval request recipient. If you select the check box, the **Recipient User ID** field is disabled because the requestor of the approval, the sender, will be notified instead. The name of the workflow response changes accordingly, to **Create Notification for &lt;Sender&gt;**. If the check box isn't selected, the name of the workflow response is **Create Notification for &lt;User&gt;**.|
       |**Recipient User ID**|Specify the user the notification must be sent to. **Note**: This option is only available for workflow responses with a placeholder for a specific user. For workflow responses without placeholders for users, the notification recipient is typically defined by the **Approval User Setup**.|
       |**Notification Entry Type**|Specify if the workflow notification is triggered by a record change, an approval request, or passed due data.|
       |**Link Target Page**|Specify another page that the link in the notification opens instead of the default page. The page must have the same source table as the record involved.|
       |**Custom Link**|Specify the URL of a link included in the notification in addition to the link to the page.|

    2. To specify options for a workflow response that involves creating an approval request, fill the fields as described in the following table.  

       |Field|Description|  
       |-----|-----------|  
       |**Due Date Formula**|Specify in how many days the approval request must be resolved from the date when it was sent.|
       |**Delegate After**|Specify if and when an approval request is automatically delegated to the relevant substitute. You can select to automatically delegate one, two, or five days after the date when the approval was requested.|
       |**Approver Type**|Specify who the approver is, according to the setup of approval users and workflow users. When the field is set to **Salesperson/Purchaser**, the user who is set up in the **Salespers./Purch. Code** field on the **Approval User Setup** page determines the approver. Approval request entries are then created according to the value in the **Approver Limit Type** field. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-workflow-users.md).|
       |**Show Confirmation Message**|Specify if a confirmation message is shown to users after they request an approval.|
       |**Approver Limit Type**|Specify how approver approval limits affect when approval request entries are created for them. A qualified approver is an approver whose approval limit is above the value on the request being made. The following options exist: <ol><li>**Approver Chain** specifies that approval request entries are created for all the requester's approvers up to and including the first qualified approver</li><li>**Direct Approver** specifies that an approval request entry is only created for the requester's immediate approver, regardless of the approver's approval limit.</li><li>**First Qualified Approver** specifies that an approval request entry is only created for the requester's first qualified approver.</li><li>**Specific Approver** specifies that you notify the user chosen in the **Approver ID** field.</li></ol>|
    3. To specify options for a workflow response that involves creating journal lines, fill the fields as described in the following table.  

       |Field|Description|  
       |-----|-----------|  
       |**General Journal Template Name**|Specify the name of the general journal template that the specified journal lines are created in.|  
       |**General Journal Batch Name**|Specify the name of the general journal batch that the specified journal lines are created in.|  

11. Choose the **Increase Indent** and **Decrease Indent** buttons to indent the event name in the **When** field to define the step's position in the workflow.  

    1. Indicate the step is next in the workflow sequence by indenting the event name under the event name of the previous step.  
    2. Indicate the step is one of several alternative steps that may start, depending on its condition, by indenting the event name to match the other alternative steps. Order such optional steps according to priority by placing the most important step first.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can only change the indent of a step that does not have a subsequent step.  

12. Repeat steps 7 through 11 to add more workflow steps, either before or after the step you've created.  
13. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle to specify that the workflow will start as soon as the event on the first step of type **Entry Point** occurs. Learn more at [Use Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Do not enable a workflow until you're sure the workflow is completed and the involved workflow steps can start.  

> [!TIP]  
> To see relations between tables used in workflows, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, then enter **Workflow – Table Relations**.  

## <a name="example-of-creating-a-new-workflow-using-existing-events"></a>Example of creating a new workflow using existing events

In the following example, a new workflow is made to approve changes to the name of en existing vendor:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **Workflow** page opens.
3. In the workflow section, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Code**|**VENDAPN-01**|
    |**Description**|**Vendor Name Change Approval** |
    |**Category**|**PURCH**|

4. To create the first workflow step, do the following.

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify *A vendor record is changed*.  
    2. In the **On Condition** field, choose the word **Always**. Then, on the **Event Conditions** page, choose the **Add a condition for when a field value changes** link, then select the *Name* field. The result of this step is that the condition reads as *Name is Changed*.  
    3. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the *Revert the value of the \<Field\> field on the record and save the change* response. Then, in the **Options for the Selected Response** section, specify the *Name* field.  
    4. Choose the **Add More Responses** link, then add an entry for the *Create an approval request for the record using approver type <%1> and <%2>* response.  
    5. In the **Options for the Selected Response** section for the new response, change the **Approver type** field to *Workflow User Group*, then, in the **Workflow User Group** field, specify the relevant user group. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).  
    6. Add a third response, *Send approval request for the record and create a notification.*  
    7. Add a fourth response, *Show message "%1"*, then, in the **Options for the Selected Response** section, in the **Message** field, specify **An approval request has been sent**.  
    8. Choose **OK** to return to the workflow step.  

5. In the next line, add a new workflow step for the *An approval request is approved.* event.

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify *An approval request is approved*.  
    2. Choose the line menu, then choose **Increase Indent**.  
    3. In the **On Condition** field, choose the word **Always**, then, in the **Pending Approvals** field, specify *0*. The result of this step is that the condition reads as *Pending Approvals:0* to indicate this is the last approver.  
    4. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the *Send approval request for the record and create a notification* response.  
    5. Choose **OK**.  
6. In the next line, add a second workflow step for the *An approval request is approved* event.  

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify *An approval request is approved*.
    2. In the **On Condition** field, choose the word **Always**, then, in the **Pending Approvals** field, specify *>0*. The result of this step is that the condition reads as *Pending Approvals:>0* to indicate this is *not* the last approver.  
    3. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the *Send approval request for the record and create a notification* response.  
    4. Choose **OK**.  
7. In the next line, add a workflow step for the *An approval request is delegated* event.  

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify *An approval request is delegated*.  
    2. In the **On Condition** field,  leave the value as *Always*.  
    3. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the *Send approval request for the record and create a notification* response.  
    4. Choose **OK**.  
8. In the next line, add a second workflow step for the *An approval request is rejected* event.  

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify *An approval request is rejected*.  
    2. In the **On Condition** field,  leave the value as *Always*.  
    3. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the *Discard the new values* response.  
    4. Choose the **Add More Responses** link, then add an entry for the *Reject the approval request for the record and create a notification* response
    5. Choose **OK**.  
9. To enable the workflow, turn on the **Enabled** toggle.  

The following illustration provides an overview of the result of this procedure.
