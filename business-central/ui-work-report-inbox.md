The **Report Inbox** page lists scheduled reports generated by the user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and can be used to not only access the generated reports, but also to share and open the files in OneDrive for Business.

> [!TIP]
> The following actions are also available in the **Report Inbox** part in the Role Centre. If the part isn't displayed in your interface, learn how to customise your Role Centre here: [Personalise Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

To save previous reports, open the **Report Inbox** page by following these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Inbox**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Report Inbox** page, choose the desired report.

> [!NOTE]
> The page does not list previous reports generated using the **Print** action or saved as a file on the **Reports** menu.
>
> The generated files are saved in the format defined when scheduling the report and can be changed on the **Job Queue Entries** page, together with the recurrence and other settings. Learn how to change the report file format and set additional options at [Manage scheduled recurring reports](ui-work-report.md#manage-scheduled-recurring-reports).

To export the report file to Microsoft OneDrive for Business, select the report on the **Report Inbox** page and choose the **Open in OneDrive** action. The report is then copied to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] folder in OneDrive and opened on a new browser window, where you can print and manage the document file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Reports set to expire on the **Schedule a Report** page and copied to OneDrive are not automatically removed from the shared folder.

Sharing reports with collaborators is also possible on the **Report Inbox** page. Select the report and choose the **Share** action. On the **Send link** page, select who can open the file, define editing permissions, then choose **Send** to send a link to access the saved report.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about OneDrive integration and features on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], including first-time setup and options to deal with file name conflicts, read the [Opening and Sharing Files in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md) article.
>
> Using the **Share** action makes the generated report file available to other users only on OneDrive for Business and does not list the scheduled report on their **Report Inbox**.
