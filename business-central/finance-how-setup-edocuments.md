# <a name="set-up-e-documents"></a>Set up e-documents

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The E-Documents core module is a framework. By default, there's no **Document Format** or **Service Integration** field. These details are part of localisation apps, because they're both specific to local requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> As of version 23.1, a standard PEPPOL document format is added as a global format in the **Document Format** field.

The first step in the configuration of electronic documents (e-documents) is to set up the E-Documents Service where you configure the complete behaviour of your system as it's related to e-document communication.

## <a name="set-up-the-e-document-service"></a>Set up the E-Document Service

Follow these steps to set up the E-Document Service.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New**, and then, on the **E-Document Service** page, on the **General** FastTab, configure the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Code | Select the electronic export setup code. |
    | Description | Enter a brief description of the electronic export setup. |
    | Document Format | <p>The export format of the electronic export setup.</p><p>By default, there are no options in this field in Wave 1.</p> |
    | Service Integration | Select the integration code for the electronic export setup. In Wave 1, the only option is **No integration**. |
    | Use Batch Processing | Specify whether the service uses batch processing for export. |

4. On the **Imported Parameters** FastTab, configure the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Validate Receiving Company | Specify whether the receiving company information must be validated during import. |
    | Resolve Unit Of Measure | Specify whether the unit of measure should be resolved during import. |
    | Lookup Item Reference | Specify whether an item should be searched by the item reference during import. |
    | Lookup Item GTIN | Specify whether an item should be searched by Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) during import. |
    | Lookup Account Mapping | Specify whether an account should be searched in **Account Mapping** by the incoming text during import. |
    | Validate Line Discount | Specify whether a line discount should be validated during import. |
    | Apply Invoice Discount | Specify whether an invoice discount should be applied during import. |
    | Verify Totals | Specify whether an invoice total should be verified during import. |
    | Update Order | Specify whether the corresponding purchase order must be updated. |
    | Create Journal Lines | Specify whether a journal line must be created instead of a purchase document. Select this option when you want to use journals as a destination for your invoices. |
    | General Journal Template Name | Specify the name of the general journal template that's used for journal line creation. This field is applicable when you want to use journals as a destination for your invoices. |
    | General Journal Batch Name | Specify the name of the general journal batch that's used for journal line creation. This field is applicable when you want to use journals as a destination for your invoices. |
    | Auto Import | Specify whether documents should be automatically imported from the service. |
    | Batch Start Time | Specify the start time for import jobs. |
    | Minutes between runs | Specify the number of minutes between import job runs. |

If you've configured the **Data Exchange Definition** format in your localisation, you can add a line for every document type that you need. However, you must first select the **Document Type** option for each line that you need. For each data type, select the **Import Data Exchange Def. Code** or **Export Data Exchange Def. Code** value that you want to use.

Eventually, if you don't use the **Data Exchange Definition** format, you can configure formats through the **Export Mapping** and **Import Mapping** lines, where you can locate the tables and fields to use and configure transformation rules if applicable.

## <a name="set-up-a-document-sending-profile"></a>Set up a document sending profile

You can set up a preferred method of sending sales documents for each customer. In this way, you don't have to select a sending option every time that you select the **Post and Send** action. On the **Document Sending Profiles** page, you can set up different sending profiles and then select among them in the **Document Sending Profile** field on a customer card. You can select the **Default** checkbox to specify that a document sending profile is the default profile for all customers, except customers where the **Document Sending Profile** field is set to a different sending profile.

This functionality is used to set up electronic invoicing automation. When you select **Post and Send** on a sales document, the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialogue box shows the sending profile that's used: either the profile that's set up for the customer or the default profile for all customers.

Follow these steps to set up a document sending profile.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Document Sending Profile**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Document Sending Profiles** page, select **New**.
3. On the **General** FastTab, enter any required field information.
4. On the **Sending Options** FastTab, configure the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Electronic Document | Specify whether the document is sent as an e-document that the customer can import into their system when you select **Post and Send**. To use this option, you must also set the **Format** or **Electronic Document Service Flow Code** field. Alternatively, the file can be saved to disk. |
    | Format | Specify the format to use to send an e-document. This field is required if you select **Through Document Exchange** in the **Electronic Document** field. |
    | Electronic Document Service Flow Code | Specify the electronic service flow that's used to send documents. This field is required if you select **Extended E-Document Service Flow** in the **Electronic Document** field. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you select **Extended E-Document Service Flow** in the **Electronic Document** field, you must already have the workflow configured for your e-documents.

## <a name="set-up-the-workflow"></a>Set up the workflow

Follow these steps to set up the workflow that's used in e-document functionality.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflow Templates**, and then select the related link.
2. If you can't find **E-Document Workflow Templates** on the **Workflow Templates** page, select **Reset Microsoft Templates**. **E-Document Workflow Templates** should then appear. Close the page.
3. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, and then select the related link.
4. Run the **New Workflow from Template** action to select a template for the e-documents process. The available templates are **Send to one service** and **Send to multiple services**.
5. Select **OK** to finish the workflow setup.
6. In the **Then Response** field, select **Send E-Document using setup** to configure the workflow responses.
7. Select the E-Document Service that you created as an option, select **OK**, and then enable the workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> You can create your own workflow for e-documents without using predefined workflow templates. If you have more services, you can use different workflows.

## <a name="set-up-a-retention-policy-for-e-documents"></a>Set up a retention policy for e-documents

E-documents can be a subject of different local legislations that are related to the period that the e-documents are kept for. Therefore, we have added a retention policy setup for all important information that's related to e-documents. Administrators can define retention policies that specify how frequently Dynamics 365 Business Central deletes outdated records that are related to e-documents. To learn more about retention policies, see [Define Retention Policies](admin-data-retention-policies.md).

To set up e-document-related retention policies, follow these steps.

1. On the **E-Document Services** page, run the **Retention Policy** action.
2. When the action is completed, select one of the following retention policies to set up:

    - E-Document Log
    - E-Document Integration Log
    - E-Document Mapping Log
    - E-Document Data Storage
