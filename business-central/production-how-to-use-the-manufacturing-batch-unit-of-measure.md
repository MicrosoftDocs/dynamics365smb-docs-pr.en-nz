title: How to Use the Manufacturing Batch Unit of Measure | Microsoft Docs
description: If an item is stocked in one unit of measure but produced in another, then the production order must be use a manufacturing batch unit of measure to calculate the correct quantity of components. An example of a manufacturing batch unit of measure calculation is when a manufactured item is stocked in pieces but produced in tons.
