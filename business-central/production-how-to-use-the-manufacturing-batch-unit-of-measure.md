# <a name="work-with-manufacturing-batch-units-of-measure"></a>Work with Manufacturing Batch Units of Measurement
If an item is stocked in one unit of measurement but produced in another, a production order is created that uses a manufacturing batch unit of measurement to calculate the correct quantity of the components during the **Refresh Production Order** batch job. An example of a manufacturing batch unit of measurement calculation is when a manufactured item is stocked in pieces but produced in tons.  

## <a name="to-create-a-production-bom-using-a-batch-unit-of-measure"></a>To create a production BOM using a batch unit of measurement  
1.  The manufacturing batch unit of measurement is set up as an alternative unit of measurement on the **Item Units of Measurement** page on the item to be produced. The batch unit of measurement will not replace the base unit of measurement on the item.  
2.  Create a production BOM for the item set up with the manufacturing batch unit of measurement. For more information, see [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).  
3.  In the **Unit of Measurement Code** field, select the manufacturing batch unit of measurement.  
4.  For each production BOM line, in the **Quantity Per** field, enter the quantity of this component item that is required to create this batch unit of measurement.  
5.  Open the **Item Card** for the related item.  

    On the **Replenishment** FastTab, in the **Production BOM No.** field, select the production BOM created above.  
6.  Create a production order header using the item set up with the manufacturing batch unit of measurement. For more information, see [Create Production Orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).  
7.  Choose the **Refresh** action, and then choose  the **OK** button.  

On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Components** action to view the result. The application calculates the correct quantity of the components needed to satisfy the production BOM based on the manufacturing batch unit of measurement.  

## <a name="to-calculate-a-manufacturing-batch-unit-of-measure-on-a-production-order"></a>To calculate a manufacturing batch unit of measurement on a production order  
1.  Create a production order header using the item set up with the manufacturing batch unit of measurement.  
2.  In the **Item No.** field in the Production Order line, type the same item number used in the header.  
3.  In the **Quantity** field, enter the same quantity used in the header.  
4.  In the **Unit of Measurement Code** field, select the manufacturing batch unit of measurement code.  
5.  Choose the **Refresh** action.
6.  On the **Calculate** FastTab, clear the **Lines** check box.  
7.  Choose the **OK** button.  
8.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Components** action to view the result. The correct quantity of the components needed to satisfy the production BOM is calculated based on the manufacturing batch unit of measurement.
