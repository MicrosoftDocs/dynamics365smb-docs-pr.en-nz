# <a name="specify-when-and-how-to-receive-notifications"></a>Specify When and How to Receive Notifications
When you set up users in approval workflows, you must specify in the **Notification Setup** and **Notification Schedule** windows how and when each user receives notifications about approval workflow steps. Individual users can also change their notification setup by choosing the **Change Notification Settings** button on any notification.  

 Before you can set up an approval userâ€™s notification preferences, you must set the user up as an approval user. For more information, [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).  

 You define the layout and content of notifications by setting up notification templates. For more information, see [Manage Notification Templates](across-how-to-manage-notification-templates.md).  

 Many approval workflow steps are about notifying users that an event has occurred that they must act on. For example, on one workflow step, the event can be that User 1 requests approval of a new record. The related response is that a notification is sent to User 2, the approver. On the next workflow step, the event can be that User 2 approves the record. The related response is that a notification is sent to User 3 to start a process with the approved record. For workflow steps that are about approval, each notification is tied to an approval entry. For more information, see [Workflow](across-workflow.md).  

## <a name="specify-when-and-how-users-receive-notifications"></a>Specify when and how users receive notifications  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Approval User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the line for the user that you want to set up notification preferences for, and then choose the **Notification Setup** action.  
3.  In the **Notification Setup** window, fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Notification Type**|Specify what type of event the notification is about.<br /><br /> Select one of the following options:<br /><br /> -   **New Record** specifies that the notification is about a new record, such as a document, that the user must act on.<br />-   **Approval** specifies that the notification is about one or more approval requests.<br />-   **Overdue** specifies that the notification is to remind users that they are late in acting on an event.|  
    |**Notification Template Code**|Specify the code of the notification template that is used to create notifications for the user.|  
    |**Unaggregated Notifications**|Specify if the user receives one notification for each event or aggregated notifications.<br /><br /> If the **Unaggregated Notifications** check box is not selected, then the user receives notifications that aggregate information about events that occur within the same recurrence pattern in the notification schedule.|  

     You have now specified how the user receives notifications. Proceed to specify when the user receives notifications.

    |**Monday** through **Sunday**|Specify on which days the user receives notifications when the value in the **Recurrence** field is **Weekly**.|
