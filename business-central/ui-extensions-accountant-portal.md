# <a name="accountant-portal-for-business-central"></a>Accountant Portal for Business Central
This application provides a dashboard with summary data for each client of an accountant. The portal displays financial KPIs as well as a direct link to the client’s financial application.  

The dashboard is a highly specialised Role Centre for a better overview of your clients.  
[![Accountant Portal](./media/ui-extensions-accportal/accountant-portal.png)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851257)

When you first install the extension, a sample company helps you get started. You can delete the sample company at any time.  

## <a name="installing-the-extension"></a>Installing the Extension
When you install the extension in your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you will be asked if you want to use it now. If you do, then you must sign out and sign in again, because the extension replaces your current Role Centre and adds permissions to your user profile.  

For more information, see [Accountant Experiences in Business Central ](finance-accounting.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The current version of the extension requires that your clients use [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  

## <a name="using-the-extension"></a>Using the extension
This extension will be deprecated in a few months. We recommend that you do not install this extension but sign up for [!INCLUDE[d365acc_long](includes/d365acc_long_md.md)] at [Business Central for Accountants on Microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/financial-insights-for-accountants) instead.

For more information, see [Welcome to Dynamics 365 — Accountant Hub](/dynamics365/accountants/index).
