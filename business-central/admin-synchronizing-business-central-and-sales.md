# <a name="synchronizing-data-in-business-central-with-common-data-service"></a>Synchronising Data in Business Central with Common Data Service

When you integrate [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can decide whether to synchronise data in selected fields of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] records (such as customers, contacts, and sales people) with equivalent records in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] (such as accounts, contacts, and users). Depending on the type of record, you can synchronise data from [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], or vice versa. For more information, see [Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md).  

Synchronisation uses the following elements:

* Integration table mappings
* Integration field mappings
* Synchronisation rules
* Coupled records

When synchronisation is set up you can couple [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] records to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records to synchronise their data. You can start a synchronisation manually, or based on a schedule. The following table provides on overview of the ways you can synchronise records.  

|  Type  |  Method  |  See  |  
|--------|----------|-------|  
|Manual synchronisation|Synchronise on a record-by-record basis.<br /><br /> You can synchronise individual records in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], such as a customer, with a corresponding [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] record, such as an account. This is typically how users will work with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] data in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].|[Couple and Synchronise Records Manually](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings)|  
|  |Synchronise on a table mapping basis.<br /><br /> You can synchronise all records in a [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] table with an entity [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entity.|[Synchronise Individual Table Mappings](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings)|  
||Synchronise all modified records for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronise all of the records that have been modified in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] tables since the last synchronisation.|[Synchronising All Modified Records](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronizing-all-modified-records)|
||Full synchronisation of all data for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronise all of the data in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] tables and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entities that are mapped, and create new records in the destination solution for uncoupled records in the source solution.<br /><br /> Full synchronisation synchronises all data and ignores coupling. Typically, you do a full synchronisation when you set up the integration and only one of solutions contains data. A full synchronisation can also be useful in a demonstration environment.|[Run a Full Synchronisation](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#run-a-full-synchronization)|  
|Scheduled synchronisation|Synchronise all changes to data for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronise [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on scheduled intervals by setting up jobs in the job queue.|[Schedule a Synchronisation](admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries.md)|  

## <a name="standard-entity-mapping-for-synchronization"></a>Standard Entity Mapping for Synchronisation
Entities in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)], such as accounts, are integrated with equivalent types of entities in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)],such as customers. To work with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] data you set up links, called couplings, between entities in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

The following table lists the standard mapping between entities in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] that [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] provides.

| [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] | [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] | Synchronisation Direction | Default Filter |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Salesperson/Purchaser | User | [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] | [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contact filter: **Status** is **No**, **User Licensed** is **Yes**, Integration user mode is **No** |
| Customer | Account | [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] | [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account filter: **Relationship Type** is **Customer** and **Status** is **Active**. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] filter: **Blocked** is blank (Customer is not blocked). |
| Vendor | Account | [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] | [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account filter: **Relationship Type** is **Vendor** and **Status** is **Active**. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] filter: **Blocked** is blank (Vendor is not blocked). |
| Contact | Contact | [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] | [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] contact filter: **Type** is **Person** and the contact is assigned to a company. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contact filter: The contact is assigned to a company and the parent customer type is **Account** |
| Currency | Transaction Currency | [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] |  |


### <a name="tip-for-admins-viewing-entity-mappings"></a>Tip for Admins: Viewing Entity Mappings
You can view the mapping between the entities in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and the tables in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, where you can also apply filters. You define the mapping between the fields in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] tables and the fields in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entities on the **Integration Field Mapping** page, where you can add additional mapping logic. For example, this can be useful if you need to troubleshoot synchronisation.
