The following table describes the options for blocking vendors.  

|Option|Description|  
|--------------------|------------|  
|**Blank**|Transactions are allowed for this vendor.|
|**Payment**|New payments cannot be created for this vendor.|  
|**All**|No transactions are allowed for this vendor.|
