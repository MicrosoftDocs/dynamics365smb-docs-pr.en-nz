# <a name="sign-up-for-a-free-dynamics-365-business-central-trial"></a>Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Business Central trial

Business Central offers a free trial. After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app with sample data. If you want to try things out with your own data, you'll switch to a free 30-day trial. [Learn more about Business Central features](across-business-functionality.md).
