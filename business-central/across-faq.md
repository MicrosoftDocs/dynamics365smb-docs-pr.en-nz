# <a name="frequently-asked-questions"></a>Frequently Asked Questions
This section contains answers to frequently asked questions about signing up for and using [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  

## <a name="what-email-address-can-i-use-with-included365finincludesd365finmdmd"></a>What email address can I use with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]?
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and others.  

If you try to sign up with a personal email address, you will get a message indicating to use a work or school email address. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Self-Service Sign-Up](ui-troubleshoot-self-signup.md).  

## <a name="do-i-have-to-buy-office-365"></a>Do I have to buy Office 365?
No. But if you want to experience [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] as fully integrated with Office 365, you can sign up for a 1-month free trial of Office 365 [here](https://products.office.com/try).  

## <a name="what-is-the-integration-with-office-365-about"></a>What is the integration with Office 365 about?
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is fully integrated with Office 365 so that you can navigate freely between Office 365 apps and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] using the app launcher. In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can open data in Excel, print reports using Word, and you can work with your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] data in Outlook, for example. For more information, see [Using [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] as your Business Inbox in Outlook](admin-outlook.md).  

## <a name="can-i-cancel-my-subscription"></a>Can I cancel my subscription?
Yes, but depending on how you signed up to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], your data can be deleted or preserved. For more information, see [Canceling [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]](admin-cancel.md).  

## <a name="where-do-i-go-if-i-have-questions"></a>Where do I go if I have questions?
If you have questions about [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] that you can't find an answer for in this documentation, you can ask the Business Central  community. For more information, see [Dynamics 365 Business Central community](https://community.dynamics.com/business). Also, our Support team post tips and tricks. For more information, see [Dynamics 365 Business Central Support Blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dyn365finsupport).  

## <a name="is-it-possible-to-extend-my-30-day-new-company-trial-period"></a>Is it possible to extend my 30-day “New Company” trial period?
Yes. If you want to extend your trial, you should contact Microsoft at 1-800-865-9408. NOTE:  It may take up to 2 business days to complete the trial extension process.  

## <a name="our-administrator-has-moved-me-to-another-plan-to-give-me-another-role-but-i-still-see-the-same-role-center-in-included365finincludesd365finmdmd"></a>Our administrator has moved me to another plan to give me another role, but I still see the same Role Centre in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]?
This is a bit complicated, but it looks like your administrator didn't change your Role Centre and assign user groups that match the new licence. Essentially, your access to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is determined by the type of plan (licence) that you have - this sets permissions and your default Role Centre page. You can change your Role Centre manually in My Settings, but if you are moved to another plan, such as moving you from the Business plan to the Team Members plan, you might see the old Home because your permissions were not changed.  

## <a name="why-cant-i-find-that-capability-in-my-included365finincludesd365finmdmd"></a>Why can't I find that capability in my [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]?
Did you read about a new capability in the roadmap or on our blog recently? In that case, your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] might not have been upgraded to the latest version yet. If the capability is published as an extension in AppSource, then there is a delay between the extension being announced and its availability in AppSource.  

## <a name="can-i-get-training-in-included365finincludesd365finmdmd"></a>Can I get training in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]?
Yes, you can. But currently, you have to ask your reselling partner. If you don't know who that is, find a Business Central partner [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/solution-providers/search).  

If you have access to Microsoft CustomerSource, you can get access to the Imagine Academy site with  eLearning material. For more information on how to get access, see the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 training](/dynamics365/get-started/training/index#dynamics-365-customers) page.  

## <a name="why-are-some-ui-elements-that-i-used-in-dynamics-nav-not-visible-in-included365finincludesd365finmdmd"></a>Why are some UI elements that I used in Dynamics NAV not visible in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]?
In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], the Application Areas system and the Experience options enable you to show/hide relevant parts of the product according to the purchased plan (Essential or Premium) and according to your business needs.

These capabilities have been used to simplify the UI in the standard version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. For example, fields that are not commonly used, such as **Fax No.**, have been removed, and on ribbons on lists and cards, duplicate actions are removed and the most-used actions are promoted. A few complete features, such as Comments, are currently being optimised for the web client and are, therefore, not available in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].

Accordingly, certain UI elements that are visible in the standard version of Dynamics NAV are not visible in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. The controls in question currently have the #Advanced application area tag.

If you want your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] solution to contain the same UI elements as your Dynamics NAV solution, you must take a couple of steps in the development environment to surface the #Advanced controls, through an extension. For more information, see [Extending Application Areas](/dynamics365/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-extending-application-areas).
