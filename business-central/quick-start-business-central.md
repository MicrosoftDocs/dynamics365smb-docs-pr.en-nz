# Business Central quick starts

Quick start articles help you get set-up sooner so you can begin performing the basic [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] functions you need.

The following sections offer beginner's guides that help you get familiar with the features you need in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Each quick start offers links to more advanced content about the functionality, should you need it.

## Provide basic information about your company

The first step is to provide the basic information about your company. The information includes things like your address, bank accounts, goods and services tax (GST) number, and so on. To learn more, go to [Company Information Quick Start](quick-start-company-information.md).

## Prepare basic financial information

Next, it's time to enter your company's financial information so you're ready to do business. To save time, you can use the chart of accounts that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides. If you need to, you can customise it in a few steps by following the [Financial Information Quick Start](quick-start-financial-information.md).
