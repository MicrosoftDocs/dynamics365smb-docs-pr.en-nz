A purchase quote can be used as a preliminary draft for a purchase order, and the order can then be converted to a purchase invoice or an order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Quotes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new document, in the same way as you make a purchase order. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

## <a name="to-convert-a-purchase-quote-to-a-purchase-order"></a>To convert a purchase quote to a purchase order

When you have accepted the vendor's quote, you can convert it to a purchase invoice or order to process the purchase.

1. Open a purchase quote that is ready to convert, and then choose the **Make Order** action.

The purchase quote is removed from the database. A purchase invoice or a purchase order is created based on the information in the purchase quote in which you can process the purchase. In the **Quote No.** field on the purchase invoice or purchase order, you can see the number of the purchase quote that it was made from.
