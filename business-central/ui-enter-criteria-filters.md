<!--
When you want to search for data, such as customer names, addresses, or product groups, you enter criteria. In search criteria you can use all the numbers and letters that you normally use in the specific field. In addition, you can use special symbols to further filter the results. There are two ways to search: using the Quick Filter or column filters.

<!--
In search criteria you can use all the numbers and letters that you normally use in the specific field. In addition, you can use special symbols to further filter the results. There are two ways to search: using the Quick Filter or column filters.-->

<!--
The Quick Filter provides an easy access to filter data by entering plain text, but does also provide a lot of search criteria options. Depending on whether you enter plain text or text including symbols, the Quick Filter behaves differently.  

* If you enter plain text in the search criteria, the search criteria is interpreted as a case insensitive search that contains certain text.  
* If you enter text including symbols in the search criteria, the search criteria is interpreted exactly as you entered it, and the search is case sensitive.
-->

|Search Criteria|Interpreted as...|Finds...|
