# <a name="bulk-invoicing-for-microsoft-bookings-in-included365finincludesd365finmdmd"></a>Bulk Invoicing for Microsoft Bookings in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]
If your company uses the Bookings app in Office 365, you can do bulk invoicing for appointments. The **Uninvoiced Bookings** window in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] provides a list of the company's completed bookings. In this page you can quickly select the appointments that you want to invoice and create draft invoices for the services provided.  

## <a name="connect-to-bookings"></a>Connect to Bookings
To connect your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] with Bookings, you must specify your Bookings company, what to synchronize with Bookings, how often to synchronize, and which templates to use. You set up this information in the **Booking Sync. Setup** window, which you can launch from the **Exchange Sync. Setup** window, which you can find through [Search](ui-search.md).  

For example, if you want to synchronize customers between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you must specify the default template to use to add new customers in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] based on the customers in your Bookings company.  

## <a name="invoice-appointments"></a>Invoice Appointments
When it is time to send invoices for the completed bookings, you go to the **Uninvoiced Bookings** window. Depending on how often the information is synchronised, the list is long or short. You can create invoices for all bookings in the list or one booking at a time. You can select one or more entries in the list and invoice those only.  

The support for invoicing appointments from Bookings is simpler than the fuller workflow of working with sales quotes, sales orders, and sales invoices. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md). You can choose to sell your services using [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] or choose to use Bookings, depending on your business needs.
