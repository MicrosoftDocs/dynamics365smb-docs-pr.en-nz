# <a name="get-started-with-the-shopify-connector"></a>Get Started with the Shopify Connector

Connect your Shopify store (or stores) with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] and maximise your business productivity. Manage and view insights from your business and your Shopify store as one unit. 

The Shopify connector includes the following capabilities:

- Support for more than one Shopify shops  

  - Each shop has its own setup, including a collection of products, locations used to calculate inventory, and price lists.  
- Bi-directional synchronisation of items or products  

  - The connector will sync images, item variants, barcodes, vendor item numbers, extended texts, and tags.  
  -    Export item attributes to Shopify.  
  -    Use selected customer price groups and discounts to define prices exported to Shopify.  
  -    Decide whether items can be created automatically or only allow updates to existing products.  
- Synchronisation of inventory levels  

  -    Choose some or all of the available locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].  
  -    Update inventory levels on multiple locations in Shopify.  
- Bi-directional synchronisation of customers  

  -    Smart-map customers by phone and email.  
  -    Use country-specific templates when creating customers, which helps ensure that tax settings are correct.  
- Import of orders from Shopify  

  -    During the import, you can automatically create customers in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] or decide to manage the customers in Shopify.  
  -    Include orders created in other channels, such as Shopify POS or Amazon.  
  -    Shipping costs, gift cards, tips, shipping and payment methods, transactions, and risk of fraud.  
  - Receive payout information from Shopify Payments.  
- Easy tracking of fulfillment information  

  -    Optionally choose to write item tracking information from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] into Shopify.
