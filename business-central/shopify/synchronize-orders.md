# <a name="synchronize-and-fulfill-sales-orders"></a>Synchronise and Fulfil Sales Orders

This article describes the necessary settings and steps that you must complete to synchronise and fulfil sales orders with Shopify in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

## <a name="set-the-import-of-orders-on-the-shopify-shop-card"></a>Set the import of orders on the Shopify Shop Card

Enter a **currency code** if your online shop uses a different currency than the local currency (LCY). The specified currency must have exchange rates configured. If your online shop uses the same currency as [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], leave the field empty. 

You can see Store Currency in the [Store details](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/general) settings in your Shopify Admin. Shopify can be configured to accept different currencies, however imported orders into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] use store currency.

A regular Shopify order can include costs in addition to the subtotal, such as shipping charges or, if enabled, tips. These amounts are posted directly to the G/L account you want used for specific transaction types:

* **Shipping Cost Account**
* **Sold Gift Card Account**; learn more at [Gift Card](synchronize-orders.md#gift-cards)
* **Tip account**  

Enable **Auto Create Orders** to automatically create sales documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] once the Shopify order is imported.

The sales document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] contains a link to the Shopify order. If you select the **Shopify Order No. on Doc. Line** field, this information is repeated in the sales lines of type *Comment*.

In the **Tax area source** field, you can set the priority on how to select US Tax area code or GST business posting group based on address. The imported Shopify order contains information about taxes, but the taxes get recalculated when you create the sales document so it's important that the GST/tax settings are correct in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information about taxes, see [Set Up Taxes for the Shopify Connection](setup-taxes.md).

### <a name="shipment-method-mapping"></a>Shipment method mapping

The **Shipment method code** for sales documents imported from Shopify can be filled in automatically. You need to configure the **Shipment Method Mapping**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shops**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to define a mapping to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Shipment Method Mapping** action. This automatically creates records for shipping methods defined in the [**Shipping**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/payments) settings in your **Shopify admin**.
4. In the **Name** field, you can see the name of the shipping method from Shopify.
5. Enter the **Shipment Method Code** with the corresponding shipping method in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]  
> If multiple shipping charges are associated with a sales order, only one will be selected as the shipping method and assigned to the sales document.

### <a name="location-mapping"></a>Location mapping

The location mapping is required for three purposes:

* To sync inventory, for more information, see [Sync inventory to Shopify](synchronize-items.md#sync-inventory-to-shopify)
* To fill in the **Location Code** for sales documents imported from Shopify. This is important when the **Location Mandatory** toggle is enabled on the **Inventory Setup** card, otherwise, you won't be able to create sales documents.
* To update the Shopify order with the fulfillment information based on the **Posted Sales Shipment** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shops**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to configure the mapping of locations to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Locations** action to open the **Shopify Shop Locations**.
4. Choose the **Get Shopify Locations** action to import all the locations defined in Shopify. You can find them in the [**Locations**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/locations) settings in your **Shopify admin** panel. Note that the location marked as *Default* will be used when importing unfulfilled Shopify orders.
5. Enter the **Default Location Code** with the corresponding location in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

## <a name="run-the-order-synchronization"></a>Run the order synchronisation

The following procedure describes how to import and update the sales orders.

> [!NOTE]  
> Archived orders in Shopify can't be imported. Deactivate the **Automatically archive the order** option in the **Order Processing** section of the **Checkout** settings in your **Shopify Admin** panel to make sure that all orders are imported to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. If you need to import archived orders, use the **Unarchive Orders** action on the [Orders](https://www.shopify.com/admin/orders) page of the **Shopify admin** panel.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shops**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to import orders to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Orders** action.
4. Choose the **Sync Orders From Shopify** action.
5. Define filters on orders as necessary. For example, you can import fully paid orders or the ones with a low-risk level.
6. Choose the **OK** button.

Alternatively, you can search for the **Sync Orders From Shopify** batch job.

You can schedule the task to be performed in an automated manner. Learn more at [Schedule recurring tasks](background.md#to-schedule-recurring-tasks).

## <a name="review-imported-orders"></a>Review imported orders

Once the import is completed, you can explore the Shopify order and find all related information, such as the payment transactions, shipping costs, risk level, order attributes and tags, or fulfillments, if the order was already fulfilled in Shopify. You can also see any order confirmation that has been sent to the customer by choosing the **Shopify Status Page** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can navigate to the **Shopify Orders** window directly and you'll see orders with the *open* status from all shops. To review completed orders, you need to open the **Shopify Orders** page from the specific **Shopify Shop Card** window.

## <a name="create-sales-documents-in-business-central"></a>Create sales documents in Business Central

If the **Auto Create Orders** toggle is enabled on the **Shopify Shop Card**, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] tries to create a sales document once the order is imported. If issues such as a missing customer or product occur, you'll need to fix the problems and then create the sales order again.

### <a name="to-create-sales-documents"></a>To create sales documents

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shops**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to synchronise orders to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Orders** action.
4. Select the order for which you want to create a sales document and choose the **Create Sales Documents** action.
5. Choose **Yes**.

If the Shopify order requires fulfillment, a **Sales Order** is created. For fulfilled Shopify orders, such as those orders that contain only a gift card or which are already handled in Shopify, a **Sales Invoice** gets created.

A sales document is now created and can be managed by using standard [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] functionality.

### <a name="manage-missing-customers"></a>Manage missing customers

If your settings prevent creating a customer automatically and a proper existing customer can't be found, you'll need to assign a customer to the Shopify order manually. There are a few ways to do this:

* You can assign the **Sell-to Customer No.** and **Bill-to Customer No.** directly on the **Shopify Orders** page by choosing a customer from the list of existing customers.
* You can select a customer template code, then create, and assign the customer via the **Create new customer** action on the **Shopify Orders** page.
* You can map an existing customer to the related **Shopify Customer** in the **Shopify Customers** window and then choose the **Find Mapping** action on the **Shopify Orders** page.

### <a name="how-the-connector-chooses-which-customer-to-use"></a>How the connector chooses which customer to use

The *Import order from Shopify* function tries to select customers in the following order:

1. If the **Default Customer No.** field is defined in the **Shopify Customer Template** for the corresponding country, then the **Default Customer No.** is used, regardless of the settings in the **Customer Import From Shopify** and **Customer Mapping Type** fields. Learn more at [Customer Template per Country](synchronize-customers.md#customer-template-per-country).
2. If the **Customer Import From Shopify** is set to *None* and the **Default Customer No.** is defined on the **Shopify Shop Card** page, then the **Default Customer No.** is used.

The next steps depend on the **Customer Mapping Type**.

* If it's **Always take the default customer**, then the connector uses the customer defined in the **Default Customer No.** field on the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
* If it's **By EMail/Phone**, the connector tries to find the existing customer by ID first, then by email, and then by phone number. If the customer isn't found, the connector creates a new customer.
* If it's **By Bill-to Info**, the connector tries to find the existing customer by ID first and then by the bill-to address information. If the customer isn't found, the connector creates a new customer.

> [!NOTE]  
> The connector uses information from the bill-to address and creates the bill-to customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. The sell-to customer is the same as the bill-to customer.

### <a name="impact-of-order-editing"></a>Impact of order editing

In Shopify:

|Edit|Impact|
|------|-----------|
|Change the fulfillment location | Original location will be synched to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. |
|Change the fulfillment location and register fulfillment in Shopify| If order was already imported, then lines won't be updated. Otherwise imported order will use Fulfillment location. |
|Edit an order and change quantity| Order header and supplementary tables will be updated in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], lines won't. |
|Edit an order and add new item | Order header will be updated, lines won't. |

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]:

|Edit|Impact|
|------|-----------|
|Change the location to another location, mapped to the Shopify Locations. Post shipment. | After synchronising the fulfilment, the location will be updated in Shopify. |
|Change the location to another location, not mapped to the Shopify Locations. Post shipment. | The fulfillment won't be synchronised with Shopify. |
|Change decrease quantity. Post shipment. | The Shopify order will be marked as partially fulfilled. |
|Add a new item. Post shipment. | The Shopify order will be marked as fulfilled. Lines won't be updated. |

## <a name="synchronize-shipments-to-shopify"></a>Synchronise shipments to Shopify

When a sales order created from a Shopify order is shipped, you can synchronise the shipments with Shopify.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sync Shipments to Shopify**, then choose the related link.
2. Define the filters on shipments as necessary. For example, you can update a shipment posted on a specific date.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

The order in Shopify will be marked as fulfilled. The customer automatically receives a shipment notice email or text message (SMS). If a shipping agent and a tracking code are specified on the shipment, the tracking information is included in the email.

Alternatively, use the **Sync Shipments** action in the Shopify Sales Orders or Shopify Shop pages.

You can schedule the task to be performed in an automated manner. Learn more at [Schedule recurring tasks](background.md#to-schedule-recurring-tasks).

>[Important] The location, including blank location, defined in the Posted Shipment Line must have a matching record in the Shopify Location. Otherwise, this line won't be sent back to Shopify. Learn more at [Location mapping](synchronize-orders.md#location-mapping).

Remember to run **Synchronise Orders from Shopify** to update the fulfillment status of an order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. The connector functionality also archives completely paid and fulfilled orders in both Shopify and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] provided the conditions are met.

### <a name="shipping-agents-and-tracking-url"></a>Shipping agents and tracking URL

If the **Posted Sales Shipment** document contains the **Shipping Agent Code** and/or **Package Tracking No.**, this information will be sent to Shopify and to the customer in the shipping confirmation email.

The tracking company is populated in the following order (from highest to lowest) based on the shipping agent record:

* **Shopify Tracking Company**
* **Name**
* **Code**

If the **Package Tracking URL** field is filled in for the shipping agent record, then the shipping confirmation will contain a tracking URL as well.

## <a name="gift-cards"></a>Gift cards

In the Shopify shop you can sell gift cards, which can be used to pay for real products.

When dealing with gift cards, it's important to enter a value in the **Sold Gift Card Account** field in the **Shopify Shop Card** window. The sold gift card will be synchronised together with orders in line. An applied gift card will also be imported with the order, but now as a transaction. Notice that the gift card doesn't reduce the amount to invoice.

To review the issued and applied gift cards, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Gift Cards**, then choose the related link.
