### <a name="scenario"></a>Scenario

Let's say that you want to try Shopify as an online store without spending much time on setup, especially because you already maintain your items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] properly. After you launch your Shopify online store, you immediately get new customers who are happy with your shop and their buying experience. So, they decide to leave tips at checkout.

### <a name="steps"></a>Steps

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Products**, and select the related link.
2. Select **Add Items**.

In the **Shopify online store**:
> [!Tip]  
> Open **Shopify admin** by navigating to the URL specified in the **URL** field of the **Shopify Shop Card** page. Select the eye icon next to the **Online Store** sales channel, located in the sidebar of **Shopify admin**. 

Open the product catalogue. Notice:

* Product titles, images, and prices.

2. In the **First name** and **Last name** fields, enter `Claudia Lawson`.
3. Enter the local address.
4. Select the **Save this information for next time** checkbox.
6. Keep *Standard* as the shipping method.

10. In the **Expiration date** field, enter the current month/year.

7. Optional: Select `10%` tip.

With *New customer accounts* a password isn't required for customers to log in, instead Shopify lets your customers log in using a one-time 6-digit verification code sent by email.

In **Shopify Admin**, notice that all products have different statuses.

* *ATHENS Mobile Pedestal* is *Archived* because we configured the shop to automatically assign status *Archived* for deleted products.

Notice that Inventory for ANTWERP Conference Table is 100, because we configured the system to use inventory only from two locations, MAIN and EAST. Inventory on another location (WEST) is ignored.

* Open *ANTWERP Conference Table*, notice the **Custom Type**, **Vendor**, **Weight**, and **Cost per item** fields, and the **Search engine listing preview** section.
