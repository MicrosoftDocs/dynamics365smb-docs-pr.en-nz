- Get a trial version. This is the typical starting point for end-users.  
- Create development stores. This approach is for partners who do recurring demos, trainings, and provide support.

> [!Note]  
> Development stores are usually password protected. When you try to open a specific page in your online store from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], for example to go to a specific product or order, you'll need to enter your password. While you're testing, to avoid having to enter your password, sign in to your Shopify admin and open your store from there. You won't need to enter the store password until you close your browser or your session expires.
