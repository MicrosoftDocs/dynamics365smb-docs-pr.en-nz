# <a name="run-tasks-in-the-background"></a>Run Tasks in the Background

It's efficient to run some tasks simultaneously and in an automated manner. You can perform such tasks in the background and can also set a schedule when you want those tasks to run automatically. To run tasks in the background, two modes are supported:

- Manually triggered tasks are scheduled immediately via **Job Queue Entries**
- Recurring tasks are scheduled in **Job Queue Entries**

## <a name="run-tasks-in-the-background-for-a-specific-shop"></a>Run tasks in the background for a specific shop

1. Go to the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter the name of **Shopify Shop**, and choose the shop name from the list.
2. Select the Shop for which you want to synchronise items to open **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Enable **Allow Background Syncs** toggle.

Now, when the sync action is triggered, instead of a task running in the foreground, it will ask you to wait. When it's completed, you can proceed to the next action. The task is created as **Job Queue Entry** and starts instantly in a non-blocking manner.

## <a name="to-schedule-recurring-tasks"></a>To schedule recurring tasks

You can schedule the following recurring activities to be performed in an automated manner. For more information about scheduling tasks, see [Job Queue](../admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).
