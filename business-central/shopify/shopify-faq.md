# <a name="faq-for-technical-details"></a>FAQ for Technical Details

This article contains a list of frequently asked questions for the Shopify connector.

## <a name="what-is-shopify"></a>What is Shopify? 

Shopify is a subscription-based software that allows anyone to set up an online store and sell their products. The Shopify platform offers online retailers a suite of services including payments, marketing, shipping, and customer engagement tools. 

## <a name="what-is-the-microsoft-dynamics-365-business-central-shopify-connector"></a>What is the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Shopify connector? 

The Shopify connector gives customers the ability to connect their Shopify store (or stores) with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to maximise business productivity. By using the Shopify connector, they can manage and view insights from their business and their Shopify online store as one unit. 

## <a name="why-did-microsoft-and-shopify-form-this-partnership"></a>Why did Microsoft and Shopify form this partnership? 

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_long.md)] is teaming up with Shopify to help our customers create a better shopping experience. While Shopify provides merchants with an easy-to-use commerce solution, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] offers comprehensive business management across finance, sales, service, and operations teams within a single application. Seamless connection between the two systems will synchronise orders, stock, and customer information to ensure merchants can fulfil orders faster and better serve customers.

## <a name="availability"></a>Availability

This feature is available only for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online, starting with version 20.1. It isn't available for on-premises deployments. The app with the connector is pre-installed for new envirnments. Organisations with existing environments can download and install the app from AppSource. The organisation must have both a Business Central licence and a Shopify licence to use the connector. For more information about supported countries, languages, and editions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], see [Shopify Connector on the AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2196238).

## <a name="support"></a>Support

The Shopify connector is covered by the current support model. For more information, see [Technical Support](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration//manage-technical-support) (in English only). 

To get help with Shopify, start with [General Shopify Help Centre](https://help.shopify.com/) or [24/7 Support for your store as a Shopify merchant](https://help.shopify.com/questions#/).

## <a name="extensibility"></a>Extensibility

Currently, this app is non-extensible. We expect to make it extensible at a time in the future that isn't currently determined.

## <a name="contribution"></a>Contribution

This extension is open for contribution by the community. You can find the [source code](https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions/tree/main/Apps/W1/Shopify) in the Microsoft AL application add-ons repository.
