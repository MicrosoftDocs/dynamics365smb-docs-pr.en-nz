# <a name="faq-for-technical-details"></a>FAQ for Technical Details

This article answers frequently asked questions about the Shopify connector.

## <a name="what-is-shopify"></a>What is Shopify? 

Shopify is a subscription-based software that allows anyone to set up an online store and sell their products. The Shopify platform offers online retailers a suite of services including payments, marketing, shipping, and customer engagement tools. 

## <a name="what-is-the-microsoft-dynamics-365-business-central-shopify-connector"></a>What is the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Shopify connector? 

With the Shopify connector, businesses can link their Shopify store (or stores) with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to maximise business productivity. Using the Shopify connector, they can manage and view insights from their business and their Shopify online store as one unit. 

### <a name="capabilities"></a>Capabilities

## <a name="why-did-microsoft-and-shopify-form-this-partnership"></a>Why did Microsoft and Shopify form this partnership? 

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_long.md)] is teaming up with Shopify to help our customers create a better shopping experience. While Shopify provides merchants with an easy-to-use commerce solution, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] offers comprehensive business management across finance, sales, service, and operations teams within a single application. Seamless connection between the two systems synchronises orders, stock and customer information so merchants can fulfil orders faster and better serve customers.
