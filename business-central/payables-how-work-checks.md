You can issue electronic and manual checks in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Both methods use the payment journal to issue cheques to vendors. You can also void cheques and view cheque ledger entries.

The following procedure shows how to pay a vendor with a computer cheque by applying the payment to the relevant vendor invoice, printing the cheque, and then posting the payment as paid. This results in positive vendor ledger entries, applied to negative bank ledger entries, and physical cheques for processing in the bank.

You can pay with two types of cheque. For both types, the **Bal. Account Type** or the **Account Type** field must contain **Bank Account**.

- **Computer Cheque**: Select this option if you want to print a cheque for the amount on the payment journal line. You must print the cheques before you can post the journal lines.
- **Manual Cheque**: Select this option if you have created a cheque manually and want to create a corresponding cheque ledger entry for this amount. By using this option, you cannot print the cheque.

> [!NOTE]  
> To make sure that your bank only clears validated cheques and amounts, you can send them a file that contains vendor, cheque, and payment information. For more information, see [Export a Positive Pay file](finance-how-positive-pay.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your printer must be correctly set up with the cheque forms, and you must define which cheque layout to use. For more information, see [Select a Cheque Layout](finance-how-define-check-layouts.md). Alternatively, you can send the cheque as a PDF file, for example.  

You can print up to 10 invoices on a page for a cheque stub. If a cheque applies to more than 10 invoices, when you print the stub we void the cheque on the first page and print the word VOID on the cheque. We then print the remainder of the invoices and the total cheque amount on the second page.

3. In the **Payment Method Code** field, select **Cheque**.
4. In the **Bank Payment Type** field, select **Computer Cheque**.

    The physical cheques can now be sent to the vendors for processing. Proceed to post the payment as applied to the vendor and thereby paid in the system.
8. Choose the **Post** action.

Fully applied vendor ledger entries and bank ledger entries are created.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to print and pay cheques in more than one currency from different bank accounts, you must run the **Print Cheque** batch job separately for each currency and specify the appropriate bank account.
