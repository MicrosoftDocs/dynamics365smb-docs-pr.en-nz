# <a name="get-started-with-included365acclongincludesd365acclongmdmd"></a>Get started with [!INCLUDE[d365acc_long](includes/d365acc_long_md.md)]
Any business must do its books and sign off on the accounting. Some businesses employ an external accountant, and others have an accountant on staff. If you are an accountant with several clients, you can use [!INCLUDE[d365acc](includes/d365acc_md.md)] as your dashboard for a better overview of your clients.  

## <a name="accountant-hub"></a>Accountant Hub
You can get access to [!INCLUDE[d365acc_long](includes/d365acc_md.md)] by signing up from [Dynamics 365 — Accountant Hub on Microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/financial-insights-for-accountants).  

> [!TIP]  
>  When you sign up for [!INCLUDE[d365acc](includes/d365acc_md.md)], you must specify your work email address, such as *me@accountant.com*. We recommend that you use the same email address when you work in your clients' [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], so that you can easily switch between clients.  

When you first log in to the accountant portal, the dashboard shows a sample client to help you get started. Once you are comfortable, you can remove that sample client.  

### <a name="working-with-individual-clients"></a>Working with Individual Clients
The dashboard shows the most important information about each client.  
[![Accountant Hub](./media/ui-extensions-accportal/accountant-portal.png)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851257)

The **Client Name** column shows the names of your clients, and the **Company Name** column lists all companies if the client has more than one company in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_ong](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. You can customise the dashboard to show the data points that you want to see by adding or removing columns. For example, you might want to see taxes that are due, how many open sales documents each client has, or the number of purchase invoices that are due next week. You can configure the view to suit your needs. If you have many clients, you can use filters to sort your view.  

Next to the client name the ellipsis reveal a short menu:

-   Refresh the current company and get fresh data for the client  
-   Go to the client's [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]  
-   Select more clients  

Similarly, you can use the **Client Summary** drop-down menu to refresh all companies, for example.  

All other work that you do for each client, you can do in the Accountant Role Center in their [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  

> [!TIP]  
>  To access a client's [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], choose the **Go To Client** menu item - you are logged in automatically.

### <a name="adding-clients"></a>Adding Clients
You can add a client by using the **Clients** window, which you can open by choosing the **Manage Clients** action in the ribbon. Simply choose **New** and then fill in the fields.  

The data in the card for each client is specified by you, and you can change it as needed. However, the **Client URL** field is critical - this is how you can access each client's [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. Use the **Test Client URL** action in the ribbon to test that you entered the right link. The URL that you must enter points at the client's [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], such as *https://mybusiness.financials.dynamics.com*. This URL is then used when you choose the **Go To Company** menu item.  

<!--If you have been invited to a client's [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and signed in with your work account, then the client will be added to your dashboard in the accountant portal. -->


### <a name="get-invited-to-a-clients-included365finlongincludesd365finlongmdmd"></a>Get Invited to a Client's [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]
A company who use [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] can invite you to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] as their external accountant by using a wizard. Also, we recommend that you enter the email that you plan to use for your accounting work - that way, you can choose if you want to use *me@accountant.com* or *me@client.com*  

As a result, you may receive two emails:

-   One from Microsoft Invitations with a link to add yourself to your client's organisation  
-   One from your client with a link to their [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]  

You can then access their financial data from the **Accountant** Role Center. If you use the **Accountant Portal** extension, you can also add that client to your list of clients in the accountant portal dashboard.
