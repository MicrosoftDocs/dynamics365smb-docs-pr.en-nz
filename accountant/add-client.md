# <a name="add-clients-to-your-dashboard-in-included365acclongincludesd365acclongmdmd"></a>Add Clients to Your Dashboard in [!INCLUDE[d365acc_long](includes/d365acc_long_md.md)]
[!INCLUDE[d365fin_early_release](includes/d365fin_early_release.md.md)]

You can add a client by using the **Clients** window, which you can open by choosing the **Manage Clients** action in the ribbon. Simply choose **New** and then fill in the fields.  

![Add a client](./media/accountant-add-client/manage-client.png)

The data in the card for each client is specified by you, and you can change it as needed. However, the **Client URL** field is critical - this is how you can access each client's [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. Use the **Test Client URL** action in the ribbon to test that you entered the right link. The URL that you must enter points at the client's [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], such as *https://mybusiness.financials.dynamics.com*. This URL is then used when you choose the **Go To Company** menu item in the [!INCLUDE[d365acc](includes/d365acc_md.md)] dashboard.  

### <a name="get-invited-to-a-clients-included365finlongincludesd365finlongmdmd"></a>Get Invited to a Client's [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]
A company who use [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] can invite you to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] as their external accountant. To get invited, you must give them the email that you use with [!INCLUDE[d365acc](includes/d365acc_md.md)], such as *me@accountant.com*. Your client's administrator can then add you to their system by running the **Invite External Accountant** wizard.  

As a result, you will receive email from your client with links to their [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. The first link is an invitation to get access to their company - open the link and accept the steps that adds you to your client's [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. The second link is for adding this client to your dashboard in [!INCLUDE[d365acc](includes/d365acc_md.md)] as described above.  

When you have accepted the invitation, you are logged in and can access the client's financial data from the **Accountant** Role Centre. For more information, see [Accountant Experiences in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]](/dynamics365/financials/finance-accounting?toc=/dynamics365/accountants/toc.json).
