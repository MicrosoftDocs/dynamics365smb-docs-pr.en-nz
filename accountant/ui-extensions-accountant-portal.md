# <a name="accountant-portal-for-dynamics-365-business-central"></a>Accountant Portal for Dynamics 365 Business Central
This application provides a portal with summary data for each client of an accountant. The portal displays financial KPIs as well as a direct link to the clientâ€™s financial application.  

The portal includes a highly specialised Role Centre that serves as a dashboard for a better overview of your clients.

When you first install the extension, a sample company helps you get started. You can delete the sample company at any time.  

## <a name="installing-the-extension"></a>Installing the extension
When you add the extension to your [!INCLUDE [d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], it replaces your current Role Center and adds permissions to your user profile. As a result, you must sign out and sign in a couple of times.
